1. Obsidian in my thinking partner. with the help of AI i want to think better and cleaner and in a connected manner. 
2. following are the new workflows that I think might work for me
    1. Like Feynman technique I will write the way I feel about the topic. my thoughts. areas need to researched upon. or delved in to. on to the markdown file just the way I am doing now. then I can get the terminal to interact with me along the way and craft a better draft. 

    2. YT transcripts can be straight up brooght in to the vault after passing through the fabric prompt eithe via gemini app or terminal and then process it side by side making atommic notes my self: there is no short cut. I need to do that. AI will not be allowed to do my wrinting for me. 

    3. get the related notes in to a single markdown file and then upload it to notebookLM. do your studying and then return back to obsidian in split view and do the atomic note processing. 
    4. Other things that I can like the legendary Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Mushashi [[Dokkodo Principles of living]] concentrate on the few tools that you use everyday. 
3. other workflows that I do for which I can incorporate AI / automations
	1. i do a mind dump now and then.  I can get AI to help me organise them into more meaningful and impactful projects/TTD productivity ; remember [[5 steps of productivity according to Daring Suthapong]] so with this method I can be more intentional and align my work 
	2. rentals and invoice handling
		1. I have couple of properties on rent 
		2. would like to have a system where rental reminders and utility bill reminders are sent regularly and efficiently
		3. there should be a way to make sure finances are met with
		4. and proper documented
		5. mainetence work
	3. my own recurring expense handling like utilities, mother's expenses etc need to be correctly aligned
	4. property management document maintenance including kahavanu trove management
	5. learning progress assessment and follow up
	6. documentation of academic output and future directions
