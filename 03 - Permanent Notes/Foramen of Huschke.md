What	is	the	foramen	of	Huschke? The foramen tympanicum, also known as the foramen of Huschke, is an anatomic variation in the tympanic portion of the temporal bone. When present, it is located at the anteroinferior aspect of the external auditory canal (EAC), posteromedial to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). In most children, the foramen tympanicum gradually becomes smaller and completely closes before the age of 5 years, but it occasionally persists. Because no neural or vascular structures pass through this defect, it is not a true foramen. Persistence of the foramen tympanicum may also predispose the person to the spread of infection or tumor from the EAC to the infratemporal fossa, and vice versa.
