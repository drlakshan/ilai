# Structured Reasoning with AI

To enhance the quality and transparency of AI-generated content, it is crucial to impose structured reasoning. Instead of simply asking the AI for an answer, command it to use specific analytical frameworks such as RRR (Risk, Reward, Resilience), SWOT, or PESTLE analysis.

This technique forces the AI to "show its work," making its reasoning process transparent and allowing you to critically evaluate its outputs. By providing a clear structure for the AI to follow, you can transform it from an erratic brainstormer into a disciplined and reliable analyst.
