### Thesis Statement
The management of Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR) is a graduated process that prioritizes foundational diet and lifestyle changes, followed by medical therapies like alginates and controversial PPIs, with antireflux surgery reserved for confirmed, non-responsive cases.

### Key Points
- **Cornerstone of Treatment:**
	- Diet and lifestyle modifications (e.g., smoking cessation, reducing alcohol/caffeine, avoiding trigger foods) : Most Critical and evidence based
	
- **Medical Therapy:**
    - Alginates act as a non-systemic barrier to protect the mucosa and are a key part of management.
    - PPI indirectly limit pepsin activation by raising gastric pH, 
    - Overall effectiveness in LPR is debated.
    
- **Combined Strategy:** 

	Life Style + Alginate + BD PPI 2- 3 months
	followed by a tapered withdrawal.
	


- **Non-Responders:** 
- 
- Patients who fail medical treatment must be re-evaluated to confirm the diagnosis (e.g., with pH/impedance monitoring) and check compliance before considering surgery.

- **Surgical Option:** Fundoplication may be considered for patients with confirmed, treatment-resistant LPR, especially if they are young and require long-term medication.
