# ID Migraine Screener

## Definition
**ID Migraine™ Screener** is a validated three-item questionnaire used to screen for migraine with high predictive value.

## The Three Questions

1. **Disability**: "Has a headache limited your activities for a day or more in the last three months?"
2. **Nausea**: "Are you nauseated when you have a headache?"
3. **Photophobia**: "Does light bother you when you have a headache?"

## Scoring and Interpretation
- **Positive result**: "Yes" to **2 or more questions**
- **High predictive value**: Strongly suggestive of migraine
- **Clinical utility**: Quick screening tool for ENT clinics

## Clinical Applications

### When to Use
- **Initial headache evaluation**
- **Triage tool** in busy clinics
- **Research screening**
- **Patient self-assessment**

### Advantages
- **Quick administration** (< 2 minutes)
- **High sensitivity and specificity**
- **Validated across populations**
- **Easy to remember and apply**

## Alternative Screening: POUND Mnemonic
Assesses headache features:
- **P**ulsating quality
- **O**ne-day duration (4-72 hours)
- **U**nilateral location
- **N**ausea/vomiting
- **D**isabling intensity

**4 or 5 features** = highly probable migraine

## Clinical Pearls
- Use as **first-line screening** tool
- **Complements clinical history**
- **Not diagnostic** - requires clinical correlation
- **Particularly useful** for atypical presentations
