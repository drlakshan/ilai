“We can define metacognition as the “thinking about thinking.” Because it refers to a person’s “knowledge and cognition about cognitive phenomena.”1,2” ([Medina et al., 2017, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/UXKE4EHQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YHQ2UXZE?page=1&annotation=CW8D8TCM))

“Metacognition refers to one’s knowledge concerning one’s own cognitive processes or anything related to them, e.g., the learning-relevant properties of information or data.

“During the learning process, metacognition guides our learning strategies. If learners know what they know and do not know, they can focus on acquiring the knowledge they are lacking.” ([Medina et al., 2017, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/UXKE4EHQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YHQ2UXZE?page=1&annotation=WGBXV7Q6))

“Metacognitive skills also have a role in critical thinking and problem solving. If you know what you know and do not know, your metacognitive skills help drive you to obtain the missing information, which we refer to as self-directed or self-regulated learning.” ([Medina et al., 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/UXKE4EHQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YHQ2UXZE?page=2&annotation=IZH7T5IM))

“being mindful or metacognitively aware can prevent medication errors in clinical settings because of increases in awareness of our thought process leading to better critical thinking and monitoring of actions.” ([Medina et al., 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/UXKE4EHQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YHQ2UXZE?page=2&annotation=DVLBXBFY))
