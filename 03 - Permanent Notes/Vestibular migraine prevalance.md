Migraine 16%
Vertigo 7%
pure coincidence 1.1%
Actually 3.2%

Both migraine and vertigo are common in the general population with lifetime [[prevalences]] of about 16 % for migraine and 7 % for vertigo. Therefore, a concurrence of the two conditions can be expected in about 1.1 % of the general population by chance alone. However, recent epidemiological evidence suggests that the actual comorbidity is higher, namely 3.2 %.
