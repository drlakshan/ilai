### Thesis Statement

Laryngeal tissue damage caused by activated pepsin 
delivered to larynx as a gaseous aerosol refluxate
remains active even at near neutral pH levels
so even brief exposure causes damage

### Key Points
- Gastric refluxate is a complex mixture
	-  hydrochloric acid, [[pepsin]], bile acids, and bacteria.
	- 
- Unlike the liquid reflux common in GORD, LPR events are often gaseous (aerosol), allowing the refluxate to easily access the larynx, nasopharynx, and lower respiratory tract.

- [[Pepsin]] is the key damaging agent. It is activated in an acidic environment (pH < 4) but, crucially, remains active and capable of causing tissue damage at pH levels approaching neutral (pH ≈ 7).

- The enzyme binds to laryngeal mucosa and can be internalized by epithelial cells via endocytosis. It is not irreversibly deactivated until pH > 8.
- 
- This persistence allows pepsin to be reactivated by subsequent acidic events, such as another reflux episode or the ingestion of acidic foods (e.g., cola), explaining why weakly acidic or non-acid reflux can still be injurious to the larynx.
