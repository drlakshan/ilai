The four steps in Niklas Luhmann's zettelkasten method are:

1. **Reading and Note-taking**:
   - Read extensively, take sparse, condensed notes as memory aids.

2. **Transforming Notes**:
   - Review day's sparse notes, create and integrate detailed zettels into the zettelkasten.

3. **Regular Review and Idea Generation**:
   - Regularly go through zettelkasten, generate new ideas, questions, and create hub notes for interconnected topics.

4. **Question-based Exploration**:
   - Pursue specific questions, use index and hub notes to navigate zettelkasten, amass relevant zettels, and develop comprehensive answers.
