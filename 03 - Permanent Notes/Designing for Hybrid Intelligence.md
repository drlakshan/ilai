# Designing for Hybrid Intelligence

To achieve the most effective human-AI collaboration, you must intentionally design workflows that combine the strengths of both AI and human intelligence. This involves consciously choreographing the partnership to achieve a symbiotic outcome that neither you nor the AI could produce alone.

This "hybrid intelligence" approach recognizes that AI excels at speed, complexity management, and data processing, while humans provide contextual understanding, ethical judgment, and creative wisdom. By designing workflows that leverage these complementary strengths, you can unlock new levels of productivity and innovation.
