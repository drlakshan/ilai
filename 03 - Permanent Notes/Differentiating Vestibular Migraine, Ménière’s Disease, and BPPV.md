# Differentiating Vestibular Migraine, Ménière’s Disease, and BPPV

Differentiating between the three most common causes of recurrent vertigo—Vestibular Migraine (VM), Ménière’s Disease (MD), and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)—is a critical skill in otolaryngology. The diagnosis relies on a careful history focusing on the duration of vertigo episodes and associated auditory symptoms, confirmed with specific clinical tests.

## Key Differentiating Features

| Feature | Vestibular Migraine (VM) | Ménière’s Disease (MD) | Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vertigo Duration** | 5 minutes to 72 hours | 20 minutes to 12 hours | Seconds to < 1 minute |
| **Auditory Symptoms**| Variable; hearing loss is uncommon and usually not persistent | **Cardinal Triad**: Fluctuating low-frequency hearing loss, roaring tinnitus, aural fullness | Typically absent |
| **Triggers** | Migraine triggers (stress, sleep changes, diet, hormones) | Typically spontaneous | Specific head position changes (e.g., rolling over in bed) |
| **Key Test Finding**| Clinical diagnosis; **Normal audiogram** between episodes | **Low-frequency SNHL** on audiogram | **Positive Dix-Hallpike test** with characteristic nystagmus |

## Clinical Pearls
*   A normal audiogram is a crucial piece of evidence to differentiate VM from MD.
*   While distinct, these conditions can coexist. Migraineurs have a higher incidence of both MD and BPPV.
