# Identifying Children with PID (Warning Signs)

The Jeffrey Modell Foundation provides a widely recognized set of ‘10 warning signs of infection’ to help clinicians identify children who may have a Primary Immunodeficiency (PID). Immunodeficiency should be considered in a child with:

*   More than four new ear infections in one year
*   More than two episodes of severe sinusitis or pneumonia
*   Infections that do not respond to routine antibiotics
*   Failure to thrive
*   A family history of immunodeficiency

Despite these indicators, studies show that it can be very difficult to differentiate between immunologically normal and abnormal children based on infection frequency alone, especially for antibody deficiencies, without other signs like poor growth.
