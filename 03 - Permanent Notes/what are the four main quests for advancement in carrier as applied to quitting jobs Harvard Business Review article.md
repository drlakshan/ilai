Based on the article, the four main quests for advancement that drive people to change jobs are:

1. Get out: People experiencing a strong desire to escape their current work situation, often due to negative factors like toxic culture, poor management, or feeling stuck.

2. Regain control: People seeking more balance, predictability, or flexibility in their work and life. They want more agency over their work environment.

3. Regain alignment: People feeling a lack of respect or appreciation at work, seeking a role where their skills and experience will be better utilized and acknowledged.

4. Take the next step: People ready to move forward in their careers after reaching a personal or professional milestone, often seeking more responsibility or better compensation/benefits.

The article emphasizes that these quests represent different ways people seek progress in their careers and lives, rather than traditional linear career progression. Understanding which quest an employee is on can help managers tailor experiences and roles to retain valuable talent.
