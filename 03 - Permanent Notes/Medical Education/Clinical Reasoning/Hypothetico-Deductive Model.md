# What Did I learn?


1. four step process of history taking, 
	1. Cue acquision
	2. Hypothesis generation
	3. Focussed Data gathering
	4. Hypothesis evaluation




# Context:



this concept I had in my mind for a long time
I create a or multiple hypotheses when I see a patient and then try to accept or refute them
now formally considering these thoughts again due to [[Akrams Map of History Taking.canvas]]

# Hypothetico-Deductive Model (HDM)

## Core Concept
Analytical reasoning process where clinicians generate early hypotheses and deductively collect targeted data to test and discriminate among them.

## Four-Stage Cyclical Process
1. **Cue Acquisition** - Identifying salient data points from chief complaint, referral, appearance
2. **Hypothesis Generation** - Rapidly generating ~5 tentative diagnostic hypotheses
3. **Focused Data Gathering** - Targeted questioning to differentiate hypotheses
4. **Hypothesis Evaluation** - Ongoing cycle of confirmation, refinement, or negation

## Clinical Application
- **Primary Users**: Novices/students (primary strategy), experts (fallback for complex cases)
- **Strengths**: Focused efficient questioning, manages complexity, handles working memory limitations
- **Limitations**: Vulnerable to premature closure and confirmation bias; quality depends on initial hypothesis generation

## Origin
Formalized by Elstein, Shulman, and Sprafka - framed diagnosis as iterative hypothesis testing rather than passive data collection.
