Teaching and Assessing Clinical Reasoning

## Core Principle
Medical education must move beyond implicit skill absorption to **deliberate and explicit cultivation** of reasoning strategies building both analytical and intuitive capabilities.

## Key Teaching Strategies

### Script Building
- Trainees draft tables of enablers, faults, consequences for common presentations
- **Assessment**: Script Concordance Tests (SCT) for reasoning under uncertainty

### Schema Workshops
- Co-create diagnostic schemas
- Rehearse discriminating questions at each node
- Enforce structured, forward-working thinking

### HDM Drills
- Require identification of **"best refuter"** for leading diagnosis
- Single historical feature that would most weaken hypothesis
- Actively combats confirmation bias

### Metacognition & Reflection
- Guided reflection with mentor discussion
- Diagnostic time-outs for self-awareness
- Recognition of thinking patterns and potential biases

## Assessment Methods
- Script Concordance Tests
- Think-aloud protocols
- Case-based discussions with reasoning articulation
- Simulated diagnostic scenarios
