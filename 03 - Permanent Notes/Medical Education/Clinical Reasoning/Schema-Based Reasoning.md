# Schema-Based Reasoning (Scheme-Inductive)

## Core Concept
Uses structured diagnostic frameworks (decision trees, flowcharts) to organize knowledge and guide questioning in pre-planned, forward-working manner.

## Mechanism
- Begins with crisp "problem representation" using semantic qualifiers (*acute*, *chronic*, *bilateral*)
- Works forward through pre-planned schema
- Questions designed to efficiently traverse decision branches

## Relationship to HDM
Schemas are **knowledge organization tools** that make HDM more effective and reproducible - not a replacement for it.

## Clinical Application
- **Strengths**: Reduces search space and cognitive load; makes HDM more reliable and reproducible
- **Limitations**: Over-schematization can miss unusual diagnoses ("zebras"); requires deliberate practice to maintain

## ENT Applications
Particularly useful for:
- Vertigo differential diagnosis schemas
- Hearing loss diagnostic flowcharts
- Neck mass evaluation algorithms
