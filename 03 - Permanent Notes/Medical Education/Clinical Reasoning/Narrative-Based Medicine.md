# Narrative-Based Medicine (NBM)

## Core Concept
Foundational approach focusing on acknowledging, absorbing, and interpreting the patient's unique illness story to gather rich contextual data.

## Core Principle
Coined by **Dr. Rita Charon**: Developing "narrative competence" - the ability to "acknowledge, absorb, interpret, and act on the stories and plights of others."

## Clinical Technique
- Open-ended invitations: *"Please tell me what you think I should know about your situation"*
- "Trustworthy listening" without interruption
- Uncovers diagnostically powerful cues embedded in patient narrative

## Relationship to Other Models
Acts as **prerequisite** for effective data gathering:
- Provides high-fidelity input for HDM (cue acquisition)
- Ensures accurate pattern matching in PRM

## Buddhist Medicine Integration
Aligns with mindful listening and compassionate presence in patient encounters.
