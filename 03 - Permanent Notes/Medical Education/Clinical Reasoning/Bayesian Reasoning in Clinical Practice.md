# Bayesian and Decision-Analytic Reasoning

## Core Concept
Formally or informally updating diagnosis probability by combining pre-test probability with statistical power (likelihood ratios) of new findings.

## Mechanism
**Pre-test Probability** + **Likelihood Ratios (LR+/LR-)** → Revised probability estimate

## Clinical Value
Clarifies why certain questions/tests are high-yield: strong likelihood ratios significantly shift probability.

## Limitations in Practice
- True Bayesian calculation rarely done explicitly at bedside
- Common errors: Mis-estimating base rates, over-weighting salient but statistically weak findings

## Relationship to HDM
- **HDM**: Supplies the *sequence* of hypothesis testing
- **Bayes**: Supplies the *mathematical reasoning* behind test selection value

## ENT Applications
- Weber/Rinne test interpretation
- Dix-Hallpike sensitivity/specificity
- CT scan value in chronic sinusitis diagnosis
