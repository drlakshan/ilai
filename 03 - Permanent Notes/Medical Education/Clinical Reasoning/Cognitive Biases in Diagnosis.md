# Cognitive Biases in Clinical Diagnosis

## Core Concept
Systematic patterns of error in judgment corrupting both intuitive and analytical reasoning - implicated in **75% of diagnostic error cases**.

## Major Biases

### Premature Closure & Anchoring
- **Anchoring**: Over-reliance on initial information
- **Premature Closure**: Accepting diagnosis before full verification, failing to consider alternatives
- *Direct causal relationship*

### Confirmation Bias
Seeking, interpreting, and recalling information that confirms pre-existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence.

### Availability Heuristic
Overestimating likelihood of easily-recalled diagnoses (recent, dramatic, emotional cases) regardless of true prevalence.

### Representation Error
Judging disease probability by fit to "classic" prototype while neglecting actual base-rate probability.

## Debiasing Strategies
- Identify "best refuter" for leading diagnosis
- Diagnostic time-outs for reflection
- Forced consideration of alternatives
- Metacognitive monitoring
