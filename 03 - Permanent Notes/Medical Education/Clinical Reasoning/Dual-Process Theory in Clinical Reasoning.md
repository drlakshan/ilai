Dual-Process Theory (DPT)

## Core Concept
Meta-model explaining skilled diagnosis as blend of fast intuitive process (System 1) and slow analytical process (System 2).

## Two Systems

### System 1 (Intuitive)02-10-2025

- Fast, automatic, unconscious, experiential
- Relies on heuristics and associations
- **Clinical manifestation**: Pattern Recognition (PRM)

### System 2 (Analytical)
- Slow, deliberate, conscious, rule-based
- Requires effort and working memory
- **Clinical manifestation**: Hypothetico-Deductive Model (HDM)

## Expertise Definition
True expertise = Reliable System 1 + **metacognitive ability** to recognize when to trigger System 2 verification.

## Clinical Application
When ambiguity or risk sensed:
- Up-regulate System 2 with explicit HDM
- Actively seek disconfirming evidence
- Use cognitive debiasing prompts
