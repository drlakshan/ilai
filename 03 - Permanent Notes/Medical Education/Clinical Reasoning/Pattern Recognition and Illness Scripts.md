# What Did I learn?
Pattern recognition uses Illness scripts which comprises of three components
	1. enabling conditions
	2. Faults : pathopjysiology
	3. Consequences : symptoms, signs and clinical  


different to [[Hypothetico-Deductive Model]] in the sense this RETRIEVES already practiced scripts (system1) where as HDM TESTS multiple possibilities

Pattern Recognition and Illness Scripts

## Core Concept
Rapid, non-analytical process where new cases are categorized by resemblance to stored mental models ("illness scripts") of diseases.

## Cognitive Basis
Functions as "System 1" (intuitive thinking) - unconscious matching of new situations to pre-existing patterns in long-term memory.

## Illness Script Components
Three interconnected elements:
- **Enabling Conditions** - Context, epidemiology, risk factors
- **Faults** - Underlying pathophysiology
- **Consequences** - Symptoms, signs, clinical findings

## Clinical Application
- **Strengths**: Very fast, cognitively efficient, underpins expert performance in routine cases
- **Failure Modes**: Prone to availability and representativeness biases; fails with atypical presentations
- **Contrast with HDM**: Scripts *retrieve* likely diagnosis then confirm; HDM *tests* multiple candidates
