##  <font color=7FFFD4>Note</font> 
Central Positional vertigo is secondary to Central Nervous System causes

e.g
Demyelinating disorders
posterior fossa tumours
posterior circulation infarctions

particularly in the region of 4th ventricle and cerebellar vermis

To differentiate from BPPV



1. Nystagmus without vertigo on positional testing
2. Presence of other localising signs
3. Failure to get corrected by positioning manoeuvres
4. Atypical nystagmus e.g downbeat

“1. Presence of other signs or symptoms of neurological disorder: 

This criterion naturally applies to all patients with balance problems, not only positional vertigo patients, but should not be overlooked during anamnesis and examination. Even when the patient complains chiefly of typical BPPV symptoms, he or she should be asked about accompanying symptoms (headache, seeing double, etc.), and cranial nerve and cerebellar function should be checked. Nevertheless, the presence of neurological symptoms not excludes the diagnosis of BPPV; in fact, BPPV is not unusual in multiple sclerosis. It has been reported a good response to repositioning manoeuvres in these patients.24,25 

2. Appearance of nystagmus without dizziness in positional tests: The opposite, the appearance of dizziness without nystagmus, should not necessarily arouse suspicion of a central lesion, because it is often seen in BPPV patients in late stages of spontaneous resolution (probably because the endolymph currents caused by vestigial otoconia are strong enough to cause dizziness but too weak to trigger nystagmus). 
3. Atypical nystagmus direction,26 especially in the following two cases. 
        a. Downward-beating vertical positional nystagmus: Although the presence of downbeating nystagmus in healthy people with migraine has been reported,27 the downbeating ‘positional’ nystagmus should be an absolute indication for an imaging study, usually MRI of the posterior fossa. Although vertical downbeating, accompanied by rotation, is also seen in patients with BPPV originated by the anterior semicircular canal, the rarity of this type of BPPV suggests that an imaging study is a prudent measure even when rotation is observed. Figure 1 shows the videonystagmographic record from a patient with a downbeating vertical” ([Soto-Varela et al., 2013, p. 319](zotero://select/library/items/DTR8V3SH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBJ63T35?page=3&annotation=QEVSKWWX))

“nystagmus in all decubitus positions of the DixHallpike test, which did not cease. This patient suffered an Arnold–Chiari malformation.

  b. Nystagmus that takes different directions in positional tests carried out at different times: If repositioning manoeuvres have not been developed (in this case, probably debris has moved from one canal to another). This should be an absolute indication for MRI of the posterior fossa, and if the MRI shows no lesions, evaluation by a neurologist should be requested. Note that the nystagmus should occur in different directions when on different occasions the ‘same’ position is adopted; if different directions are followed when the patient is placed in different positions, he or she probably has BPPV originated by more than one canal.28,29 4. Poor response to therapeutic manoeuvres: If repeated performance of manoeuvres designed to dislodge and relocate otoconia fails to resolve the symptoms, MRI of the posterior fossa should be requested. MRI of the posterior fossa should of course always be carried out before referral for surgical therapy. In patients with poor response to ‘manoeuvres’, MRI is also useful for detecting anatomical abnormalities in semicircular canals.30 5. Frequent recurrence of symptoms: The recurrence of BPPV following successful treatment with therapeutic manoeuvres is not uncommon. The expected rate of recurrences in a follow-up period of 10 years in our patients diagnosed with posterior semicircular canal BPPV (in a series of 419 patients) was 27%.31 This data were similar to those reported in a study made in a geographical area close, and published recently.32 However, other authors have reported recurrence rates of up to 50% at 5-year33 or 10-year34 follow-up. Multiple recurrence should nevertheless not be automatically interpreted as recalcitrant BPPV (perhaps, due to some property of the patient’s otoconia making them particularly prone to displacement), but should instead suggest that the symptoms may have a central origin. As only 3% of the above-mentioned 419 patients suffered more than two recurrences, requesting MRI studies in these cases would not overload MRI services. Conclusion Experience of the results of using classical criteria for suspicion of non-benign PV, together with advances in our understanding of BPPV, suggest that these criteria are currently less than satisfactory. We propose the following revised criteria for suspected non-benign positional vertigo. 1. Association with signs or symptoms of neurological disorder. 2. Nystagmus without dizziness in positional diagnostic tests. 3. Atypical nystagmus direction, especially a. downward-beating vertical nystagmus, and b. nystagmus that takes different directions in positional tests carried out at different times. 4. Poor response to therapeutic manoeuvres. 5. Recurrence (confirmed by positional tests) on at least three occasions.” ([Soto-Varela et al., 2013, p. 320](zotero://select/library/items/DTR8V3SH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HBJ63T35?page=4&annotation=D7NLLEBK))
