What is telemedicine?




“Telemedicine refers to delivering remote clinical services over a distance, such as medical education, remote patient monitoring, patient consultation via videoconferencing, wireless health applications, and transmission of imaging and medical reports.8” ([Manning and Gillespie, 2022, p. 146](zotero://select/library/items/QHLWT7VG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FHHN2ME9?page=2&annotation=B7W9XJ7P))

“Telehealth has a broader definition and can also include nonclinical activities, such as provider training, administrative meetings, continuing medical education, and public health functions.” ([Manning and Gillespie, 2022, p. 146](zotero://select/library/items/QHLWT7VG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FHHN2ME9?page=2&annotation=483VTJDG))

“According to the World Health Organization, the term digital health is rooted in eHealth, which is defined as “the use of information and communications technology in support of health and health-related fields.”9 The World Health Organization further defines mobile health (mHealth) as a subset of eHealth and is defined as “the use of mobile wireless technologies for public health.”9 The term digital health was introduced as “.a term encompassing eHealth (which includes mHealth), as well as emerging areas, such as the use of advanced computing sciences in ‘big data,’ genomics and artificial intelligence.”9” ([Manning and Gillespie, 2022, p. 146](zotero://select/library/items/QHLWT7VG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FHHN2ME9?page=2&annotation=3VSJY4H8))
