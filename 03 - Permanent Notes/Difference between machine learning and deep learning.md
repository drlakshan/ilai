# What Did I learn?


Deep learning is a subset of machine learning
Other subsets include linear regression decision trees support vector machines etc

The primary difference between Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) is that DL is a subset of ML that uses a specific architecture called deep artificial neural networks to learn.
You can visualize the relationship as a set of concentric circles: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the outermost, Machine Learning is inside AI, and Deep Learning is inside ML .
Here are the key distinctions:
| Feature | Machine Learning (ML) | Deep Learning (DL) |
|---|---|---|
| Relationship | A sub-field of AI. | A subset of Machine Learning. |
| Architecture | Uses various algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines). | Primarily uses Artificial Neural Networks with multiple hidden layers (hence "deep"). |
| Feature Engineering | Requires manual feature extraction (human intervention to select/prioritize data attributes). | Automatic feature learning (the network learns the relevant features directly from the raw data). |
| Data Required | Can perform well with relatively smaller datasets. Performance often plateaus after a certain data volume. | Requires very large datasets to train effectively and achieve high performance. |
| Computational Power | Can run efficiently on standard CPUs. | Requires powerful GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) due to the complexity of the deep neural networks. |
| Complexity | Generally less complex; better suited for well-defined, structured data tasks. | More complex; excels at complex tasks involving unstructured data (images, audio, text). |
| Interpretability | Generally easier to interpret and explain the model's decision process. | Often considered a "black box" because the complex layered structure makes it difficult to interpret the decision-making process. |
In essence, DL automates more of the learning process than traditional ML, especially the crucial step of feature extraction, but it demands far more data and computing power to do so.
