Year 2023 was amazing. My primary achievement is Obsidian based knowledge management. I managed to condense ENT knowledge and all my thinking in to obsidian. My obsidian vault grew to 10,000 over the year starting from 1200 notes in the December of 2022.

The quality of notes also improved and the connections I developed helped me to come up with new insights and understanding. With the vault and knowledge improving I managed to produce 10 articles over the year. 

I am documenting the academic performance on the notion database and use that as the grounding document.
