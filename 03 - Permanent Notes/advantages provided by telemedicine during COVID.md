“Telemedicine demonstrated multiple rewards for individual and public health during the COVID-19 pandemic that continue to provide benefit. Remote screening and management of persons who needed clinical care for COVID-19 and other conditions increased access to care when many outpatient offices were closed or had limited operating hours.11 The increased availability of telemedicine services reduced disease exposure for staff members and patients, preserved scarce supplies of personal protective equipment, and minimized patient surges on facilities.11,17 In addition, many patients seeking telehealth in the early pandemic period were managed at home, which reduced large volumes of patients seeking care at health care facilities that were in the midst of a surge of COVID-19 cases.11 Access to telehealth services was also valuable for patients who were reluctant to seek in-person care, had difficulty accessing in-person care, or had chronic conditions that placed them at high risk for severe COVID-19.11” ([Manning and Gillespie, 2022, p. 147](zotero://select/library/items/QHLWT7VG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FHHN2ME9?page=3&annotation=CEW5I2DA)) These are the COVID related benefits of telemedicine
