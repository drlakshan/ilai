**Concept:**

Death cleaning, or _döstädning_ in Swedish, is the practice of methodically decluttering and organizing your belongings before you pass away. The primary goal is to lessen the burden on family and friends who would otherwise have to sort through your possessions.

Far from being a morbid practice, it is framed as a practical and considerate act of love. It's a process of taking control of your possessions, reflecting on your life, and mindfully deciding what to keep, give away, or discard. It can be a therapeutic opportunity to revisit memories and share the stories connected to your belongings. While often undertaken by people over 50, its principles of simplifying and organizing can be applied at any age. The process is intended to be slow, steady, and ongoing.

**Key Principles:**

- **Start with less sentimental items:** Begin with easier categories like clothes, books, or kitchen duplicates before tackling items with strong emotional attachments, such as photographs, letters, and heirlooms.
- **Vocalize your intentions:** Let your friends and family know that you are organizing your things. This opens up conversations and gives them an opportunity to claim items they might cherish.
- **Create a "throw-away" box:** This is a designated box for intensely personal items that have sentimental value only to you (e.g., old love letters, private diaries). Your family can be instructed to discard this box without reading its contents, respecting your privacy while simplifying their task.
- **Organize important documents:** This process isn't just about physical objects. A crucial part is organizing essential documents, such as your will, financial records, and digital passwords, to make administration easier for your loved ones.
