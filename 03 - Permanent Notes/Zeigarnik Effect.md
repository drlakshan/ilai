This effect describes how our unfinished tasks remain active in our minds intruding into our thoughts and our sleep until they are dealt with.

eg. hungry person will notice every restaurant and appetising smell on their way home
As soon as it is finshed you dont remember it.

e.g. in exams when crammed you promptly forget everything as you no longer has a need to it

waiter who remembered every detail about the individual orders forgot the psychiatrist Bluma Zeigarnik who went in search of lost purse.


She found that those who had had their work interrupted were about twice as likely to remember what they had been doing as the participants who had actually completed the tasks.
