The video, "Designing the Rest of Your Life" by Dave Evans, focuses on applying design thinking principles to create a fulfilling and intentional life. Based on the video, here’s an actionable plan you can follow:

### Actionable Plan for Designing Your Life

#### 1. **Adopt a Designer’s Mindset**
   - Embrace curiosity: Approach life with an open mind and a willingness to explore new possibilities.
   - Reframe problems: Shift your perspective on challenges to see them as opportunities for growth.
   - Prototype solutions: Test ideas and experiences in small, low-risk ways before committing fully.

#### 2. **Define Your Life Goals**
   - Identify what matters most to you: Reflect on your values, passions, and priorities.
   - Write down your goals: Break them into short-term (1-2 years), medium-term (3-5 years), and long-term (10+ years) objectives.

#### 3. **Create Multiple Life Plans** odyssey planning at least 3
   - Develop three different versions of your future:
     1. **Plan A**: Continue on your current path and optimize it.
     2. **Plan B**: Explore a completely different career or lifestyle.
     3. **Plan C**: Imagine a life where you start over with no constraints.
   - Evaluate each plan based on feasibility, excitement, and alignment with your values.

#### 4. **Prototype Your Ideas**
   - Take small steps to test your plans:
     - Shadow someone in a role you’re interested in.
     - Take a short course or workshop to explore a new skill.
     - Volunteer or take on a side project to experience a different field.
   - Gather feedback and refine your plans based on what you learn.

#### 5. **Build a Support Network**
   - Surround yourself with people who inspire and challenge you.
   - Seek mentors, peers, and friends who can provide guidance and accountability.
   - Share your plans and ideas to gain diverse perspectives.

#### 6. **Embrace Iteration**
   - Accept that life is a work in progress: Be flexible and willing to adapt as circumstances change.
   - Regularly review your goals and plans to ensure they remain relevant and meaningful.
   - Celebrate small wins and learn from setbacks.

#### 7. **Take Action**
   - Commit to one small step today: Choose an action that aligns with one of your life plans and start immediately.
   - Set deadlines for your prototypes and evaluate their outcomes.
   - Keep moving forward, even if progress feels slow.
