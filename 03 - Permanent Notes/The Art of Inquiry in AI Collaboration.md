# The Art of Inquiry in AI Collaboration

In the age of AI, the core skill is not having the answers, but mastering the art of inquiry. This "Second Socratic Inversion" means that your primary task is to learn how to ask better, more incisive questions and to critically review the answers the AI provides.

By focusing on inquiry, you can guide the collaborative process toward deeper insight and avoid the pitfalls of accepting AI-generated content at face value. This approach emphasizes critical thinking and intellectual curiosity as the key drivers of value in human-AI partnerships.
