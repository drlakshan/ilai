# TMD and Migraine Bidirectional Association

## Definition
**Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD)** and migraine have a **strong bidirectional association**, meaning they frequently co-exist and exacerbate one another.

## Prevalence Data

### TMD Patients with Headaches
- **60% of TMD patients** have concurrent headaches
- **Most commonly migraine** among headache types

### Headache Patients with TMD
- **~59% of primary headache patients** show clinical signs of TMD

## Pathophysiological Basis
- **Shared trigeminal pain pathways**
- **Central sensitization** affecting both systems
- **Muscle tension** as common trigger

## Clinical Manifestations

### TMD Triggers Migraine
- **Jaw clenching**
- **Masticatory muscle tension**
- **Bruxism**
- **Malocclusion-related strain**

### Migraine Exacerbates TMD
- **Increased muscle tension** during attacks
- **Altered pain perception**
- **Stress-related jaw clenching**

## Management Approach

### Multidisciplinary Strategy
1. **TMD Management**:
   - Bite splints/occlusal guards
   - Physical therapy
   - Stress reduction techniques

2. **Pharmacological Options**:
   - NSAIDs
   - Muscle relaxants
   - TCAs (amitriptyline)
   - Gabapentin

### Clinical Impact
- **Managing TMD can significantly reduce headache frequency**
- **Integrated approach improves both conditions**
- **Prevents years of misdirected treatment**
