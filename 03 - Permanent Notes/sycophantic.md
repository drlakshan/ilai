# reference
"Sycophantic" is an adjective used to describe someone who behaves or speaks in an obsequious way toward someone important in order to gain advantage. Essentially, it means being a "flatterer" or "yes-man/yes-person" in an excessive and often insincere manner.
Key characteristics of sycophantic behavior include:
 * Excessive Flattery: Praising someone overly, often beyond what is deserved or genuine.
 * Obsequiousness: Being overly attentive, compliant, or servile towards a person of power or influence.
 * Self-Serving Motivation: The primary goal is usually to gain personal favor, advantage, promotion, or approval from the person being flattered.
 * Insincerity: The flattery and agreeable behavior are often not genuine reflections of the sycophant's true feelings or beliefs.
In simple terms, a sycophantic person tries to win favor by flattering influential people. The behavior itself is described as sycophantic.
For example: "His sycophantic praise of the CEO was embarrassing to witness."
