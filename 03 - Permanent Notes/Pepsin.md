# Pepsin

#physiology #stub

Pepsin is a key digestive enzyme found in gastric [[Refluxate]]. It is the primary agent of tissue damage in [[Pathophysiology of Laryngopharyngeal Reflux]].

It is activated in an acidic environment (pH < 4) but remains active at near-neutral pH levels, allowing it to damage the sensitive laryngeal mucosa.
