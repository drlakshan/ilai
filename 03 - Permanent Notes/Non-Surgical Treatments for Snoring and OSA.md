### Non-Surgical Treatments for Snoring and OSA
*   **Thesis:** Non-surgical treatments, including lifestyle modifications and devices like CPAP and Mandibular Advancement Splints (MAS), are the first-line approach for managing snoring and OSA.
*   **Key Points:**
    *   Lifestyle changes include weight loss, avoiding alcohol and smoking, positional therapy, and exercise.
    *   Mandibular Advancement Splints (MAS) are effective for simple snoring and mild-to-moderate OSA by advancing the mandible.
    *   Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard treatment for moderate-to-severe OSA, acting as a pneumatic splint for the airway.
