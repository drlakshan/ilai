This man keeps on coming. I am on a quest to combine three states of intelligence. 
Lord Buddha's supreme intelligence, AI and use my own processing power to create things magical. For this I need to enhance all three. 

In this quest I came across this man many a times.
He not only epitomises the scientific discovery but he relates to somthing above all of us. 

"His psychic experiences and mystical episodes of brilliance were a perennial aberration. And yet, publicly, he denied any truth to the suggestions that he possessed such tendencies for fear of not being taken seriously, being misunderstood or just having his research discarded as nonsensical."

he progressive development of men is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative mind. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs. This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements. Speaking for myself, I have already had more than my full measure of this exquisite enjoyment; so much, that for many years my life was little short of continuous rapture. I am credited with being one of the hardest workers and perhaps I am, if thought is the equivalent of labour, for I have devoted to it almost all of my waking hours.[[1]](https://www.icrcanada.org/research/literaryresearch/tesla?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email#cite_note-1)


I am completely worn out, in fact, and yet I cannot stop my work. These experiments of mine are so important, so beautiful, so fascinating, that I can hardly tear myself away from them to eat, and when I try to sleep, I think about them constantly. I expect that I shall go on until I break down altogether.”"


. . . nature has given me a vivid imagination which, through incessant exercise and training, study of scientific subjects and verification of theories through experiment, has become very accurate and precise . . . In the first place, it [my life] was charmed . . . In my youth my ignorance and lightheartedness brought me into innumerable difficulties, dangers and scrapes from which I extricated myself as by enchantment . . . I was nearly drowned a dozen times. I was almost cremated three or four times and just missed being boiled alive. I was buried, abandoned, and frozen . . . I have passed through dreadful diseases––have been given up by physicians three or four times in my life for good . . . I cannot think of anything that did not happen to me and to realize that I am here this evening, hale and hearty, young in mind and body, with all these fruitful years behind me [age 61] is little short of a miracle . . . What I wish to say particularly is that my early life was really extraordinary in certain experiences which led to everything I ever did afterwards . . . From childhood I was afflicted in a singular way––I would see images of objects and scenes with a strong display of light and of much greater vividness than those I had observed before . . . My theory is that they were simply reflex actions from the brain on the retina, superinduced by hyperexcitation of the nerves . . . My head was always clear as a bell and I had no fear . . . In order to free myself of these tormenting appearances [images of discomforting events], I tried to fix my mind on some other picture or image which I had seen and, in this way, I would manage to get some relief . . . Then I began to make excursions beyond the limits of the little world I knew, and I saw new scenes . . . and so I started to travel––of course in my mind. . . . when I hit upon the idea of travelling, it seemed to me that was the greatest discovery possible to me. Every night (and sometimes during the day), as soon as I was alone, I would start on my travels. I would see new places, cities and countries. I would live there, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances and these were just as dear to me as those in real life and not a bit less intense. That is the way I did until I reached almost manhood. When I turned my thoughts to invention, I found I could visualize my conceptions with the greatest facility. I did not need any models, drawings or experiments, I could do it all in my mind and I did . . . My method [of materializing inventive concepts] is different. I do not rush into constructive work. When I get an idea, I start right away to build it up in my mind. I change the structure, I make improvements, I experiment, I run the device in my mind . . . I then construct the final product of my brain. Every time my device works as I conceive it should and my experiment comes out exactly as I plan it. In twenty years, there has not been a single solitary experiment which did not turn out precisely as I thought it would, why should it not? . .



His psychic experiences and mystical episodes of brilliance were a perennial aberration. And yet, publicly, he denied any truth to the suggestions that he possessed such tendencies for fear of not being taken seriously, being misunderstood or just having his research discarded as nonsensical.

What a monumental moment, as an appreciative assembly witnessed the divulging of an unorthodox inventive process of imaginative visualization which brought to fruition scores of revolutionary discoveries. These inventions would not only change the lives of those in the audience, but of the entire planet and, as such, the very direction of human evolution
