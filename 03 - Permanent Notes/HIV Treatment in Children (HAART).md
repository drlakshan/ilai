in children with HIV : standard treatment is HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy)






# HIV Treatment in Children (HAART)

Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) is the standard treatment for children with HIV. The decision to start HAART is based on a combination of symptoms and CD4 count. Many common ENT presentations occur in children who are otherwise relatively well and may not require immediate treatment unless their CD4 count is low.

Age-specific thresholds guide the initiation of HAART. Most children show rapid immune reconstitution after starting therapy, but residual damage from past infections may require ongoing ENT input.
