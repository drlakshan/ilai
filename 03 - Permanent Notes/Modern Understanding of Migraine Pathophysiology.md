# Modern Understanding of Migraine Pathophysiology

## Core Concept
Migraine is now understood as a complex, heritable neurologic condition characterized by **neuronal hyperexcitability** and **altered sensory processing**, not merely a vascular disorder.

## Key Mechanisms

### 1. Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD)
- **Definition**: Self-propagating wave of neuronal depolarization across cerebral cortex
- **Role**: Electrophysiological correlate of migraine aura
- **Clinical Impact**: May extend into vestibular cortex, contributing to vestibular symptoms

### 2. Trigeminal Vascular System (TVS)
- **Components**: Trigeminal nerve endings innervating intracranial blood vessels
- **Function**: Anatomical substrate for migraine pain
- **Activation**: Triggers neurogenic inflammation through neuropeptide release

### 3. Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP)
- **Role**: Potent vasodilator and primary mediator in migraine
- **Function**: Crucial for nociceptive signaling
- **Clinical Significance**: 
  - Elevated during migraine attacks
  - Elevated interictally in migraineurs
  - Key therapeutic target

## Central Sensitization
These mechanisms create a "**sensitive brain**" state where neurons become hyperexcitable, leading to:

- **Photophobia** (light sensitivity)
- **Phonophobia** (sound sensitivity) 
- **Osmophobia** (smell sensitivity)
- **Motion Sensitivity** (vertigo/dizziness)

## ENT-Relevant Pathways

### Trigamino-Vestibulocochlear Reflex
- Trigeminal nerve fibers directly innervate inner ear structures
- TVS activation causes CGRP release in inner ear
- Produces: vertigo, tinnitus, aural fullness

### Trigamino-Autonomic Reflex
- Trigeminal activation triggers parasympathetic outflow
- Via sphenopalatine ganglion
- Causes: nasal congestion, clear rhinorrhea, lacrimation, facial pressure
