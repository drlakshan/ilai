[[Zettlekasten method steps]]

#zettelkasten 



>>See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise. [...] Take more notes, develop ideas further and see where things will take you.
	Just follow your interest and always take the path that promises the most insight. Build upon what you have. Even if you don't have anything in your slip-box yet, you never start from scratch you already have ideas on your mind to be tested, opinions to be challenged and questions to be answered. Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters. [...] The more you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect and the more likely it is that you will generate questions from it.<<
