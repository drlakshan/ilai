# Vestibular Migraine: Diagnosis and Clinical Features

Vestibular Migraine (VM) is a variant of migraine, now recognized as the most common cause of recurrent spontaneous vertigo. The diagnosis is clinical, based on criteria established by the Bárány Society and the International Headache Society (IHS). It is crucial to understand that headache is often mild or absent during vestibular episodes.

## Diagnostic Criteria (Definite VM)
1.  At least five episodes of moderate-to-severe vestibular symptoms (e.g., spinning, rocking, internal dizziness) lasting 5 minutes to 72 hours.
2.  A current or previous history of migraine with or without aura.
3.  One or more migrainous features (headache, photophobia/phonophobia, visual aura) occurring with at least 50% of the vestibular episodes.
4.  Not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis.

## Clinical Pearls
*   **Symptom Variability**: The vestibular symptoms can vary widely between and within patients.
*   **Temporal Lag**: There is often a significant time lag between the onset of typical migraine headaches (average age 28) and the onset of vestibular symptoms (average age 49).
*   **Exclusionary Testing**: Ancillary tests like audiograms and VNGs are not used to diagnose VM directly but are critical for excluding other conditions, especially [[Ménière’s Disease]]. A normal audiogram in the context of recurrent vertigo strongly supports a VM diagnosis.
