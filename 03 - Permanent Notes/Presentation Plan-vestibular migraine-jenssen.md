1. Sensory diregulation  multisensory convergence zones
2. Trigeminovascular theory  
3. Genetic predisposition  

Sensory dysregulation is another term used to describe VM pathophysiology. This concept emphasizes the role of multisensory integration in processing and modulating  
incoming stimuli to derive perception of the environment. Multisensory convergence zones exist within the superior colliculus, basal ganglia, premotor cortex, posterior pa  
rietal cortex, inferior prefrontal cortex, and posterior superior temporal sulcus.  
  
  
The trigeminovascular theory of VM emphasizes the activation and sensitization of trigeminal sensory afferent neurons, which stimulate cranial tissues.26,27  
This vasodilation and inflammation is thought to result in pain or "central sensitization" andcludes some of the same receptors involved in vestibular system activation (eg,  
calcitonin gene-related peptide and serotonin).28-33 Direct central activation of vestibular nuclei by the trigeminovascular system may be a cause of VM.<
