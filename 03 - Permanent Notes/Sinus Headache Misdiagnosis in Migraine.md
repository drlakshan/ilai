# Sinus Headache Misdiagnosis in Migraine

## The Problem
**"Sinus headache" is the most common misdiagnosis of migraine**, with 88-90% of patients with self-diagnosed "sinus headaches" actually meeting migraine criteria.

## Mechanism: Trigamino-Autonomic Reflex
Migraine triggers parasympathetic outflow from the sphenopalatine ganglion, causing:
- **Nasal congestion**
- **Clear rhinorrhea** 
- **Lacrimation**
- **Facial pressure**

These symptoms mimic sinusitis, leading to misdiagnosis.

## Key Differentiators

### True Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS)
- **Purulent nasal discharge** (thick, discolored)
- **Fever**
- **Constant pain**
- **Resolution with antibiotics**

### Migraine-Associated Rhinorrhea
- **Clear and watery discharge**
- **Episodic nature**
- **Associated with headache triggers**
- **No fever**

## Clinical Pearls
1. **Ask about discharge character**: Purulent vs clear
2. **Assess pain pattern**: Constant vs episodic
3. **Check for fever**: Present in true sinusitis
4. **Evaluate response to antibiotics**: True sinusitis responds

## Impact
- Leads to unnecessary sinus procedures
- Delays appropriate migraine treatment
- Causes patient frustration and continued suffering
