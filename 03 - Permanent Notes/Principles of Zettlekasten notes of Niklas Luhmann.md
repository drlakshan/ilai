## Note
1. Types : Fleeting, literature and permanent
2. Notes are taken with writing as the objective 
3. One note per idea and all notes have a same format (like a template)
4. note sequencing is to develop ideas (rather than storing data)
5. links and indices are helpful but not the central part of the system
