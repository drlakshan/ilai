Its an approach to access maxillary sinus through the nose using endoscope



Advantage of the approach is anterior and lateral walls of the maxillary sinus can be approached through this. 

How to do it:

1. infiltrate the floor of the nasal cavity an inferior turbinate area
2. diathermy incisions 
3. elevate the flap on the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus up to the infraorbital nerve
4. Medially cut the Nasolacrimal duct sharply and remove the inferior turbinate
5. So there is a common cavity now as the lateral nasal wall is now removed and the anterior wall also removed up to the infraorbital nerve 
6. Now we can access the maxillary sinus endoscopically
