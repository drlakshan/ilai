# The Mapmaker's Apprentice: A Story of Learning Transformed

## Opening Hook for AI Workshop - Physiological Society of Sri Lanka

---

In the ancient city of Alexandria, there lived a young cartographer named Amara who dreamed of creating the most accurate map of the known world. For years, she studied under Master Theon, memorizing every coastline, every mountain range, every trade route that merchants had documented.

Her training was rigorous: trace these exact maps, memorize these coordinates, reproduce what has been drawn before. "Precision," Master Theon would say, "comes from perfect replication."

One day, a strange merchant arrived at the mapmaker's guild with an unusual instrument—a [[astrolabe]] unlike any Amara had seen. But this astrolabe could do something extraordinary: when Amara asked it questions about navigation, it could show her not just one route, but thousands of possibilities she had never imagined.

"Show me the fastest route to India," she asked.

The astrolabe illuminated twelve different paths, each with trade-offs she hadn't considered: monsoon seasons, political territories, underwater currents.

"But Master Theon taught me there's only one correct route," Amara protested.

The merchant smiled. "Your master taught you the routes that were known when he was learning. But what if you could ask: 'What routes might exist that no one has drawn yet? What if I combined knowledge of winds, tides, and star patterns in ways that haven't been tried?'"

Amara began experimenting. She would sketch a hypothesis—"What if ships could navigate by following whale migrations?"—and the astrolabe would help her explore the implications, showing her marine biology data, seasonal patterns, historical observations she'd never have found in a hundred scrolls.

But here's what changed everything: **Amara realized the astrolabe couldn't tell her which questions to ask.** It couldn't feel the wonder she felt watching ships return to harbor. It couldn't dream of undiscovered islands or imagine what lay beyond the edges of her maps.

The astrolabe was powerful, but it needed her curiosity, her judgment, her human insight to know what was worth exploring.

Together, they created something neither could have made alone: maps that were not just accurate reproductions of the past, but living documents that posed new questions. "What if we're wrong about this coastline?" "Could there be a southern continent?" "What patterns connect tides to the moon?"

Other cartographers were scandalized. "She's not learning properly!" they said. "She's not memorizing the classic maps!"

But Amara's students—the ones who learned to dance between human curiosity and the astrolabe's vast knowledge—began discovering things that had been hidden in plain sight for centuries. They found patterns in ocean currents that explained why certain routes worked. They predicted seasonal changes that saved lives. They asked questions no one had thought to ask before.

The old mapmakers were afraid their expertise would become worthless. But Amara discovered something profound: **the astrolabe made her expertise more valuable, not less.** Because now, instead of spending years copying old maps, she could spend her time on what only a human could do—asking the questions that mattered, interpreting what the answers meant for real sailors on real journeys, dreaming of what might lie beyond the known world.

## The Question for You

Today, you stand where Amara stood. You have spent years—decades perhaps—building your expertise in medicine and physiology. You've memorized, practiced, refined your craft.

And now, a new kind of astrolabe has arrived.

Some fear it will replace medical education as we know it. Others wonder if students using AI will truly understand physiology or merely learn to prompt an algorithm.

But what if we're asking the wrong questions?

**What if AI in medical education isn't about replacing human expertise, but about amplifying it?**

**What if, freed from some of the memorization burden, medical students could spend more time on clinical reasoning, patient empathy, and the questions that don't have clear answers yet?**

**What if AI could help us discover patterns in physiology that have been hiding in our data all along—patterns we couldn't see because we were too busy with routine tasks?**

Like Amara, we don't yet know all the routes this new instrument opens. We don't know which possibilities will prove valuable and which will lead nowhere.

But we do know this: **the AI cannot tell us which questions matter. It cannot feel a patient's suffering. It cannot dream of better treatments or imagine connections that change paradigms.**

That's your superpower. That's what makes you irreplaceable.

Today, in this workshop, we're going to explore how to dance between human wisdom and artificial intelligence. Not to replace one with the other, but to discover what becomes possible when they work together.

We're not here to predict the future of medical education with certainty.

**We're here to imagine what maps we might draw together—human and AI—that neither could create alone.**

Shall we begin?
