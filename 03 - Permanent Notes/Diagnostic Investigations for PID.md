# Diagnostic Investigations for PID

The European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) provides a clear pathway for investigating potential Primary Immunodeficiency (PID) in children with recurrent ENT infections.

1.  **Initial Screening**:
    *   Full Blood Count (FBC)
    *   Measurement of IgG, IgA, and IgM
2.  **Secondary Investigations** (if initial tests are abnormal):
    *   Lymphocyte subsets (to check B-cell numbers if immunoglobulins are low).
    *   Evaluation of responses to routine immunizations (e.g., Hib, tetanus, Pneumococcus).
3.  **Further Investigations** (for persistent symptoms):
    *   IgG subclasses
    *   Mannose-binding lectin (MBL)
    *   Complement studies (CH50, APCH50)

Children with other concerning features (e.g., failure to thrive, family history) should be discussed with a local immunology service.
