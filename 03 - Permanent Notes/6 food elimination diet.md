# What Did I learn?


1. milk
2. eggs
3. wheat
4. soy
5. peanuts/tree nuts
6. sea food



there are other food elimination diets
[[4 food elimination diet]]

[[2 food elimination diet]]

but most effective is 6 food elimination diet



# Context:

I am learning about the newly (at least for me ) introduced diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis

“7.1. Dietary Treatment In the 1990s, the first studies considered food allergens to be the main antigenic trigger of EoE. This led to testing the elimination of six food groups that account for the majority of IgE-mediated food reactions (milk, wheat, egg, soy, nuts, and seafood) in many pediatric and adult studies with high clinical and histologic remission rates [76]. This contributed to the creation of less restrictive diets, as it was proven that nuts and fish/seafood rarely trigger EoE, and the most common food triggers were milk and gluten [76]. Three dietary exclusion diets are considered. Diet-related clinical improvement by excluding certain food antigens suggests that food induces a CD4 + Type-2 allergic inflammatory response [5]. The most restrictive diet is a six-food elimination diet (6-FED), comprising the avoidance of cow’s milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanuts, and seafood. A less restrictive option is the four-food elimination diet (4-FED), which eliminates cow’s milk, wheat, egg, and soy. The least restrictive and the most comfortable diet for the patient is the two-food elimination diet (2-FED) which involves the removal of cow’s milk and wheat. Unfortunately, being the most comfortable for the patient does not mean that it will guarantee the greatest effectiveness. Studies have shown that for the above-mentioned diets, the highest remission was achieved when six components are eliminated in 50–71% of patients [4,77]. In the case of the diets excluding four and two components, remission was achieved in 46–54 and 43–44% of cases, respectively [10,77]. Therefore, considering the patient’s habits, a step-up empiric approach to food elimination was proposed, beginning with the two-food elimination diet (2-FED) [78]. If remission is not observed after 8–12 weeks from the treatment, 4-FED is initiated, and if this diet fails, 6-FED is introduced [78]. Theoretically, it seems that it would be most convenient for the patient and potentially make the greatest improvement to eliminate specific antigens from the food after allergy testing. However, this method is not recommende” ([Wąsik and Małecka-Wojciesko, 2023, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/MT8EXNWJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2FDRT9Q?page=9&annotation=BJL7MFC2))
