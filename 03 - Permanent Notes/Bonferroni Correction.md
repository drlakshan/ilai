######  Note


When we are comparing many variables, there is a chance that the difference can be due to chance as we are comparing many variables
therefore if we have a large number of comparisons to make for examples genes sequences or multi item questionnaires we have to make an allowance for the number of items there.


p value needed = (0.05)/(#of comparisons)
