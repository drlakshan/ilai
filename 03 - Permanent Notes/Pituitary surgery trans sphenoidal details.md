**PMID**: 32310602

## Overview
Transsphenoidal hypophysectomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure to remove pituitary tumors through the nasal passages and sphenoid sinus. The approach eliminates external incisions, reduces scarring, and shortens recovery time.

## Historical Development
- **1907**: First performed by Hermann Schloffer
- **1910**: Popularized by Harvey Cushing and Oskar Hirsch
- **1965**: Revolutionized by Jules Hardy with microscope introduction and fluoroscopy
- **1994**: Endoscopic techniques developed by Egyptian surgeons

## Surgical Approaches

### Transcranial Approaches
1. Anterior (subfrontal)
2. Pterional

### Extracranial Approaches
1. Microscopic transsphenoidal (transnasal/sublabial)
2. Transnasal endoscopic

## Key Indications
- Pituitary adenomas (most common)
- Tumors causing visual abnormalities (bilateral peripheral visual field loss)
- Secreting adenomas causing:
  - Cushing disease
  - Acromegaly
  - Amenorrhea causing infertility
- Parasellar lesions
- Progressive enlargement on sequential MRI

## Primary Surgical Objectives
1. Maximal safe tumor removal
2. Restoring neurological functions
3. Decompressing pituitary gland
4. Preservation of normal pituitary function

## Potential Complications

### Nonendocrine Complications
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks
- Sinusitis
- Meningitis
- Optic nerve injury
- Vascular injury
- Epistaxis

### Endocrine Complications
- Diabetes insipidus (DI)
- Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)
- Hypopituitarism
- Adrenal insufficiency

## Interprofessional Team
The procedure requires collaboration between:
- Neurosurgeons
- Otolaryngologists (ENT surgeons)
- Endocrinologists
- Radiologists
- Specialized nursing staff
- Anesthesiologists

## Detailed Surgical Anatomy

### Sella Turcica Anatomy
**Midline saddle-shaped depression in sphenoid bone**

**Components**:
- **Floor**: Posterior roof of sphenoid sinus
- **Anterior wall**: Begins at posterior tuberculum sella
- **Lateral walls**: Dural reflection between anterior and posterior clinoid processes
- **Posterior wall**: Vertical dorsum sellae
- **Superior wall**: Diaphragma sella (dural fold)

### Critical Surrounding Structures

#### Cavernous Sinuses (Bilateral)
- **Location**: Lateral to sella turcica
- **Contents**:
  - Cranial nerve III (Oculomotor)
  - Cranial nerve IV (Trochlear)
  - Cranial nerve V1 (Ophthalmic division of trigeminal)
  - Cranial nerve VI (Abducens)
  - Cavernous carotid arteries

#### Optic Chiasm
- **Location**: Chiasmatic sulcus, superior to diaphragma sella
- **Significance**: Risk of injury with suprasellar extension

#### Internal Carotid Artery (ICA)
- **Course**: Extends superiorly from cavernous sinus
- **Anterior genu**: Located within sphenoid sinus
- **Injury risk**: Approximately 5%

### Sphenoid Sinus Pneumatization Patterns
**Four types affecting surgical approach**:

1. **Conchal**: Minimal pneumatization (least common)
2. **Presellar**: Posterior wall anterior to sella
3. **Sellar**: Posterior wall between sella walls (most common type)
4. **Postsellar**: Extends beyond dorsum sella

### Nasal Cavity Surgical Corridor

**Anatomical Pathway**:
- Between nasal septum and middle turbinate

**Sphenoid Ostia Landmarks**:
- **Location**: Medial to superior turbinate
- **Distance from choana**: 1.5 cm above
- **Distance from nasal sill**: 7 cm at 30° angle
- **Distance from skull base**: 11 mm

### Key Anatomical Variations & Surgical Risks

**Optic Nerve Canal**:
- Dehiscence present in 4-8% of cases
- Increased risk of nerve injury

**Carotid Artery**:
- Injury risk: ~5%
- Variable course through sphenoid sinus
- Requires careful preoperative imaging

**Anatomical Variations**:
- Sphenoid sinus septation patterns
- Opticocarotid recess depth
- Sellar floor thickness
- Pneumatization extent

## Modern Technique Evolution
Evolution from:
- Open craniotomy � Microscopic transsphenoidal � Fully endoscopic endonasal procedure

## Clinical Significance
- Preferred approach for most pituitary adenomas
- Lower morbidity compared to transcranial approaches
- Shorter hospital stays
- Faster recovery times
- Reduced postoperative complications when performed by experienced surgeons
