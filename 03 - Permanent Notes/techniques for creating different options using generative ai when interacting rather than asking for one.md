Techniques for Generating Different Options Using Generative AI: 
1. Tweaking or Editing: Make slight tweaks or edits to the prompt and regenerate the options.
2. Starting a New Conversation: Begin a new conversation with the same prompt to get independent responses. 
3. Switching Conversations: Switch the conversation to generate new options. 
4. Varying Levels of Abstraction: Consider varying the approach, technique, or tone. 
5. Trying Different Language Model Tools: Explore different large language model tools.
6. Collecting Multiple Solutions: Generate multiple options using different techniques, approaches, or tools.
