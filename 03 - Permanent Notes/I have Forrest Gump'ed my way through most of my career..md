"I have Forest Gumped my way" is a phrase inspired by the movie _Forrest Gump_ (1994), where the main character, Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, unwittingly finds himself in various significant historical events, often succeeding through a mix of luck, simplicity, and sincerity rather than through deliberate effort or skill.

When someone says they "have Forest Gumped their way" through something, it usually means they have succeeded or navigated a situation by chance, luck, or a series of fortunate events, often without a clear plan or deep understanding of how they managed to do so. It's a humble or humorous way of acknowledging that their success wasn't necessarily due to intentional or calculated actions.
