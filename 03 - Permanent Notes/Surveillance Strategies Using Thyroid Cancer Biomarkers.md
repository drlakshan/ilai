# What Did I learn?



MTC
1. calcitonin doubling time 
	1. <2y Poor short-term prognosis
	2. >2years : indolent course standard monitoring
2. CEA doubling time: secondary prognostic marker

Risk-Adapted Surveillance
1. enhanced imaging frequency high risk molecular profiles
2. BRAF/TERT positive patients closer follow up
3. low risk de-escalation


marker kinetics


[[BRAF-TERT Mutations in PTC]]
[[TERT Promoter Mutation]]
