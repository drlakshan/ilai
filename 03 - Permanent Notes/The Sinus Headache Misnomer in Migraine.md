# The "Sinus Headache" Misnomer in Migraine

A significant majority (estimated at 88-90%) of patients who self-diagnose with "sinus headaches" actually meet the diagnostic criteria for migraine. This common misdiagnosis stems from the autonomic symptoms that a migraine attack can produce, which closely mimic the symptoms of rhinosinusitis.

## Mechanism: Trigamino-Autonomic Reflex
The underlying mechanism is the **Trigamino-Autonomic Reflex**. Activation of the trigeminal nerve during a migraine attack triggers parasympathetic outflow from the sphenopalatine ganglion. This reflex directly causes:
*   Nasal congestion and stuffiness
*   Clear, watery rhinorrhea (runny nose)
*   Facial pressure and a sensation of fullness over the sinuses

## Differentiating Features
The key to differentiating a migraine attack from true acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) lies in the character of the nasal discharge and other systemic signs.

| Feature | Migraine Attack | Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nasal Discharge** | Clear, watery | **Purulent** (thick, discolored yellow/green) |
| **Fever** | Typically absent | Often present |
| **Pain Pattern** | Often pulsating, unilateral, disabling | Constant, localized pressure |
| **Associated Symptoms**| Nausea, photophobia, phonophobia | Often absent |
| **Response to Tx** | Responds to triptans/CGRP antagonists | Responds to antibiotics |
