### Rhinology & Facial Plastic Surgery

| Surgery/Procedure                                             | Medicolegal Implications                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nasal fracture manipulation / early septorhinoplasty          | Delay beyond the 21-day window forces formal septorhinoplasty with extra morbidity, so slow referral is rarely defensible.                                                                    |
| Elective septorhinoplasty / rhinoplasty                       | High expectations demand documented counselling on realistic outcomes, revision rates, potential deformities (pollybeak, saddle nose) and costs.                                              |
| Frontal sinus trephine / Lynch–Howarth drainage               | Injury to supraorbital or supratrochlear nerves and trochlea detachment must be anticipated and disclosed; lateral extension without need is indefensible.                                    |
| Caldwell–Luc procedure                                        | Supraorbital retractor neuropraxia is avoidable whereas infraorbital nerve neuropraxia is a recognised risk; technique and consent should reflect this.                                       |
| Septal surgery (septoplasty / submucous resection)            | Saddle deformity or perforation can signal missed infection or over-resection; investigate granulomatous disease, warn preoperatively, and respond promptly.                                  |
| Septal haematoma drainage                                     | Failure to identify and drain leads to septal abscess, saddle nose and high-value cosmetic claims.                                                                                            |
| Inferior turbinectomy                                         | Posterior resections frequently trigger torrential haemorrhage; patients, especially adolescents, need explicit warning and documented understanding.                                         |
| Diagnostic maxillary puncture / examination under anaesthesia | Carries risk to unerupted dentition, infraorbital nerve and orbit and may progress to biopsy or adenoidectomy—consent must cover all possible interventions.                                  |
| Endoscopic sinus surgery                                      | Requires intra-operative orbital monitoring and vigilant post-op checks for retrobulbar haemorrhage or CSF leak; delayed recognition of visual or intracranial complications is indefensible. |
| Benign skin lesion excision                                   | Scarring is inevitable; explain length, maturation time and colour change, and always send tissue for histology to avoid missed malignancy claims.                                            |
| Keloid / hypertrophic scar revision                           | Warn high-risk patients about recurrence, use correct steroid strength to avoid fat atrophy, and document the limits of revision.                                                             |
| Pinnaplasty (Stenström / Mustardé)                            | Meticulous haemostasis and dressings prevent haematoma and cauliflower ear; counsel on recurrence, keloid risk and need to report post-op pain immediately.                                   |
| Skin grafting                                                 | Colour or contour mismatch, graft loss from haematoma/infection and donor-site scarring demand clear pre-op advice and structured aftercare.                                                  |
| Skin flaps                                                    | Flaps can necrose or remain bulky; careful design, execution and counselling on secondary scars are vital to defend outcomes.                                                                 |
| Facelift (rhytidectomy)                                       | Selection and documented expectations, haemostasis, flap viability and facial nerve protection underpin defensible practice, especially in smokers.                                           |
| Mentoplasty (chin augmentation)                               | Ill-fitting implants or mental nerve injury cause visible deformity; discuss migration, haematoma, infection and bone resorption risk.                                                        |
| Malar augmentation                                            | Access routes risk Stensen’s duct or infraorbital nerve damage; secure implants to prevent displacement and lower-lid retraction.                                                             |
| Blepharoplasty                                                | Consent must cover dry eye, haematoma-related blindness, corneal injury (never defensible), lagophthalmos and ectropion; precise skin excision avoids exposure keratitis.                     |
| Laser skin resurfacing                                        | Infection and pigment change are common; darker skin is contraindicated and any post-op infection needs rapid treatment to avoid scarring claims.                                             |
| Rhinophyma debulking                                          | Over-aggressive excision or dermabrasion causes slow healing and disfiguring scars; infection worsens loss and full-thickness excision with grafting is unacceptable.                         |

### Otology & Neuro-otology

| Surgery/Procedure | Medicolegal Implications |
| --- | --- |
| Cochlear implantation timing | Diagnostic delay that misses the early implantation window undermines speech outcomes and fuels damages. |
| Stapedotomy / stapedectomy | Congenital anomalies need pre-op CT and meticulous consent; perilymph gushers, prosthesis mishaps or delayed leak/granuloma management leading to a dead ear are hard to defend. |
| Ear syringing | Skipping history for prior perforation or surgery and leaving wet wax invites infection and perforation claims; avoid caloric shocks and canal trauma. |
| Mastoidectomy & cholesteatoma surgery | Facial nerve injury from poor landmark recognition and incomplete disease clearance (e.g. failed atticotomy) are recurrent claim drivers. |
| Canal wall up vs down cholesteatoma surgery | Operation choice affects employability (e.g. armed forces); Montgomery requires documented shared decision-making. |
| Saccus decompression surgery | Facial nerve, posterior canal, dura or lateral sinus injuries demand imaging review; packing a solitary sinus without checking scans and causing venous catastrophe is indefensible. |
| Tympanic neurectomy for “hypersalivation” | Offering neurectomy without a sound indication after failed sinus surgery displays poor judgement and invites litigation when symptoms persist. |
| Sham saccus decompression | Billing for surgery never performed (shown on CT) is fraudulent; operative records must match the procedure delivered. |
| Posterior cranial fossa operations | Sudden deafness after vestibular schwannoma, meningioma or decompression procedures requires clear documentation of vascular and nerve risks. |

### Paediatric Otolaryngology

| Surgery/Procedure | Medicolegal Implications |
| --- | --- |
| Tonsillectomy / adenoidectomy | Consent must cover the 5–10% bleed rate, transfusion or life-threat risk, dental trauma and diathermy burns; document warnings. |
| Palatal surgery during tonsil work | Excessive resection causing lasting velopharyngeal incompetence is indefensible; careful diathermy use prevents burns and perforation. |
| Paediatric tracheotomy | Tube dislodgement or blockage from thick secretions demands trained nursing, aggressive suction protocols and readiness to replace the tube; failure causes hypoxic injury. |
| Foreign body removal (ear, nose, airway, oesophagus) | Forceful restraint or delayed bronchoscopy risks perforation, bronchiectasis or chemical burns; button batteries require emergency removal. |
| Cervical lymph node open biopsy | Posterior triangle exploration must identify and protect the accessory nerve, with technique documented, to avoid shoulder-drop claims. |
| ENT surgery in Down syndrome with atlanto-axial instability | Treat all as unstable during procedures like myringoplasty; careless head movement can produce cord injury and indefensible outcomes. |

### Head & Neck Surgery

| Surgery/Procedure                            | Medicolegal Implications                                                                                                                                           |     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| Thyroidectomy                                | Immediate haemorrhage control (clip remover at bedside) and documentation of RLN/SLN risk, pre-op laryngoscopy and calcium monitoring are critical.                |     |
| Submandibular duct stone surgery             | Warn patients about retained stones; lavage and radiographic comparison prevent infection-related claims.                                                          |     |
| Submandibulectomy                            | Assume malignancy until disproven; record how marginal mandibular, lingual and hypoglossal nerves were protected, as palsies remain common.                        |     |
| Parotidectomy & chronic sialadenitis surgery | Discuss high facial nerve risk, residual tissue, and management of salivary fistulae (botulinum toxin, ligation, glue) with MDT oversight for tumours.             |     |
| Skull-base parotid tumour excision           | Identify the facial nerve in normal anatomy (mastoid or peripheral) to avoid injuring a displaced trunk and be prepared to graft if malignancy mandates sacrifice. |     |
| Microlaryngoscopy for chronic laryngitis     | Exhaust conservative options and warn professional voice users that mucosal tethering or persistent dysphonia may follow biopsy or stripping.                      |     |
