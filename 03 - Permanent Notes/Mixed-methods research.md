this is a type of research where qunatitaive and qualitiative data colletion methods are combined within the same study



# Reference

#### Common Designs

Several standard mixed-methods designs are frequently used:

- **Convergent parallel design**: Collecting quantitative and qualitative data simultaneously, analyzing them separately, and then comparing or combining the results
- **Explanatory sequential design**: Collecting and analyzing quantitative data first, then using qualitative methods to help explain the quantitative findings
- **Exploratory sequential design**: Beginning with qualitative research to explore a topic, then using those findings to inform subsequent quantitative research
- **Embedded design**: Where one data type plays a supplementary role within a study that is predominantly based on the other data type

#### Advantages

- Provides stronger evidence through convergence and corroboration of findings
- Adds insights and understanding that might be missed when using only a single method
- Increases the validity of results through triangulation
- Helps answer complex research questions that cannot be fully addressed by either quantitative or qualitative approaches alone

#### Challenges

- Requires researcher expertise in both quantitative and qualitative methods
- Can be more time-consuming and resource-intensive
- May present difficulties in integrating different types of data
- Sometimes faces philosophical tensions between different research paradigms
