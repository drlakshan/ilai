“Why didn’t the spreadsheet just directly talk to the email program to get the expense? Because they don’t speak the same language, understand the concepts (e.g., email thread vs. cell), and mostly refuse to help each other. We hear about ”interoperability”, but it is limited or doesn’t exist in most cases.” ([White, 2024, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/PRR6WIH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GXFL574?page=3&annotation=7EFNHN4M))

“It’s like translating a poem from one language to another - you capture the general meaning, but subtleties and cultural context often get lost.” ([White, 2024, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/PRR6WIH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GXFL574?page=3&annotation=NYC2Q55E))

“Everyone is still talking about ”Return on Investment” and ”finding the right use cases” for Generative AI. The use case is obvious. We need to fix our translation problem in computing and software. We need to use this new technology to build living software systems that can dynamically evolve to accomplish a goal based on the actual conte” ([White, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/PRR6WIH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GXFL574?page=4&annotation=C9EQLYJQ))

“Programs for these tools are hidden prompts, often called ”system prompts” or ”root prompts”, that sit behind the scenes providing the guardrails and strategies it uses to solve problems. An entire program might consist of: ”Any time I give you a travel expense, check my existing list of travel expenses using the Get Expenses API, make sure it isn’t a duplicate, and then enter it with the Add Expense API.”” ([White, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/PRR6WIH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GXFL574?page=4&annotation=KG8PKDHU))

“Prompt Engineering is about learning to decompose and express goals in ways that allow Generative AI to reason effectively about them” ([White, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/PRR6WIH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GXFL574?page=4&annotation=UYDHLWGE))

“It is about learning how to train our Generative AI, like an intern, to help us.” ([White, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/PRR6WIH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GXFL574?page=4&annotation=ZUKZQA5Z))

“he goal of Prompt Engineering is to help people learn how to express their goals in a much richer format than they are used to for consumption by Generative AI.” ([White, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/PRR6WIH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GXFL574?page=4&annotation=IRC4PXJR))

“The goal is to help people learn to support their own problem solving skills by realizing that, accurate expression of the problem itself in text, photos, video, and audio is now a critical task in computing.” ([White, 2024, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/PRR6WIH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GXFL574?page=4&annotation=MZVF7XGU))

“Everyone gets way too hung up on Generative AI making mistakes. Yes, it does. However, the focus shouldn’t be on firing the intern, the focus should be on: 1) giving the intern the right tasks to help with, 2) phrasing the tasks and the outputs in a way that they can be fact checked, and 3) incorporating the work into our existing human processes for testing and verification.” ([White, 2024, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/PRR6WIH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GXFL574?page=5&annotation=V9BY8T74))

“Here is a simple prompt that shows the right way to get supporting references out of Generative AI: Here are the sources: ————1. ...some source... 2. ...some other source... Please summarize the sources and provide quotations from each source supporting the summary. Cite the number of the source above in the format [X], where X is the source number.” ([White, 2024, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/PRR6WIH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GXFL574?page=5&annotation=VYN3VM78))

“Alan Watts once said, ”The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance”” ([White, 2024, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/PRR6WIH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3GXFL574?page=5&annotation=IULCQVZN))
