**Bárány Society and International Headache Society criteria:**

1. **At least 5 episodes** of moderate-to-severe vestibular symptoms
2. **Duration**: 5 minutes to 72 hours
3. **Current or previous history** of migraine
4. **One or more migraine features** with at least 50% of episodes:
   - Headache with migraine characteristics
   - Photophobia and phonophobia
   - Visual aura

## Clinical Features

### Temporal Pattern
- **Average age of migraine onset**: 28 years
- **Average age of vestibular symptoms**: 49 years
- **Time lag**: ~21 years between headache and vertigo onset

### Symptom Characteristics
- **Headache**: Often mild or absent during vestibular episodes
- **Vertigo**: Variable description (spinning, rocking, internal dizziness)
- **Frequency**: Episodic, not continuous

## Differential Diagnosis

| Feature | Vestibular Migraine | Ménière's Disease | BPPV |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|------|
| **Vertigo Duration** | 5 min - 72 hours | 20 min - 12 hours | Seconds - <1 min |
| **Auditory Symptoms** | Variable, hearing loss uncommon | **Cardinal**: Fluctuating low-frequency HL | Typically absent |
| **Triggers** | Migraine triggers | Typically spontaneous | Specific head positions |
| **Key Test** | Clinical diagnosis | Audiogram shows low-freq SNHL | Positive Dix-Hallpike |

## Prevalence
- **General population**: ~1%
- **Most common cause** of recurrent spontaneous vertigo
