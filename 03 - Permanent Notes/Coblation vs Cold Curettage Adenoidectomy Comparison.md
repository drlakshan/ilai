# Coblation vs Cold Curettage Adenoidectomy Comparison

## Evidence-Based Advantages of Coblation
- **Reduced intraoperative blood loss** compared to cold curettage
- **Shorter period of postoperative discomfort**
- **Lower likelihood of injury to adjacent tissues**
- **Enhanced precision of adenoid removal**
- **Should be considered the standard technique** based on comparative studies

## Clinical Significance
Hapalia et al. (2022) demonstrated superior outcomes across multiple parameters, supporting coblation as preferred technique over traditional cold curettage method.

## Source Evidence
Based on comparative study evaluating multiple surgical parameters between techniques.
