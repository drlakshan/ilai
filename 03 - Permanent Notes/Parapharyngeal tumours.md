> "Surgical approach A variety of surgical approaches have been utilized for excision of these masses (Table 2), the most common being a transcervical approach [3,4,6,32]. This approach allows for exposure of neurovascular structures and maintains sterility by preventing oralflora contamination [32]. A disadvantage of this approach can be limited exposure superiorly and medially [3,37], however this is not often the case. The transoral approach allows greater exposure for tumors extending significantly into the oropharynx and allows dissection medial to the carotid artery, such as with our patient. This cosmetically preferable approach should only be used in the rare circumstances where a tumor can be excised safely and effectively. Due to limited exposure of the great vessels, there can be increased risks with this approach. Other risks include tumor rupture, unidentified cranial nerve injury,fistula, and post-operative hematoma or seroma as no drain can be placed [5,6,32]. The endoscopic-assisted transoral approach and transoral robotic approach are gaining popularity for prestyloid PPS masses since they allow for the benefits of the transoral approach along with an extended surgical view that reduces the probability of neurovascular injury and capsule rupture [38-40]. The transcervical approach can be additionally combined with other approaches such as the transoral or transparotid in order to allow even greater exposure [32,41]. Needlessto-say, patients should be consented for the possibility of multiple approaches when appropriate. Lastly, certain tumors have case-specific surgical considerations. For example, schwannomas can be enucleated using intraoperative neural monitoring in order to achieve intracapsular tumor excision and allow for greater preservation of nerve integrity and function [32,42]. Preoperative embolization is often considered with carotid body tumors, although this is not routinely done at our institution. This practice has been called into question with recent studies showing no difference in blood loss between embolized and non-embolized patients [22,43]. Ultimately, management of PPS masses requires a patient-centered multidisciplinary approach that is individualized according to patient symptoms, comorbidities, tumor size, suspected diagnosis, and patient preferences."
