# What Did I learn?



Skull base osteomyelitis
[[Psuedomonas aeruginosa]]
Technicium 99 scan good for diagnosis in correct clinical context but not good for follow up
Gallium citrate scan for inflammatory cells so good for follow up



# Context:


# Malignant Otitis Externa (MOE)

Severe, invasive infection of external ear and skull base requiring aggressive management.

**Risk Factors**:
- Diabetic patients (most common)
- Immunocompromised states

**Diagnostic Approach**:
- CT scans for bony involvement
- Cultures for pathogen identification (*P. aeruginosa* predominant)
- High index of suspicion in at-risk populations

**Management Strategy**:
- Long-term systemic antibiotics (oral ciprofloxacin standard)
- **Meticulous blood sugar control** in diabetics (critical)
- Prolonged therapy (weeks to months)
- Serial imaging to assess response

**Key Principle**: MOE is skull base osteomyelitis - requires systemic, not topical, therapy.
