The craftsman's mindset, as popularized by Cal Newport in his book "So Good They Can't Ignore You," focuses on building valuable skills and creating work you love. Here are the key components:
 * Focus on Skills, Not Passion: Newport argues that passion often follows mastery, not the other way around. By developing rare and valuable skills, you become more marketable and find work that aligns with your strengths.
   
 * Deliberate Practice: Continuous improvement is essential. Deliberate practice involves focused effort, specific goals, and feedback to refine your skills and push your boundaries.
   
 * Build a Portfolio: Showcase your skills and accomplishments through a portfolio or body of work. This demonstrates your expertise and attracts potential employers or clients.
   
 * Find a Craft: Identify a specific skill or area of expertise you want to master. This gives you a clear direction and purpose in your career.
   
 * Create Leverage: Once you've mastered a skill, leverage it to create opportunities for yourself. This could involve freelancing, starting a business, or negotiating for better roles.
   
 * Build a Network: Connect with other professionals in your field to learn, collaborate, and find new opportunities.
   
 * Embrace the Long Game: Building a fulfilling career takes time and effort. Focus on continuous improvement and long-term goals rather than short-term gains.
   
By embracing the craftsman's mindset, you can take control of your career, build a rewarding life, and make a significant impact on the world.
