# Basic ENT Investigation Modalities

## 1. Pure Tone Audiogram (PTA)
- Gold standard test for hearing assessment
- Measures hearing thresholds at different frequencies (250Hz - 8000Hz)
- Air and bone conduction testing
- Helps differentiate conductive vs sensorineural hearing loss

## 2. Tympanogram
- Assesses middle ear function and tympanic membrane mobility
- Types: A (normal), B (flat), C (negative pressure)
- Essential for diagnosing middle ear effusions and Eustachian tube dysfunction

## 3. Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE)
- Tests cochlear outer hair cell function
- Used in newborn hearing screening
- Quick, non-invasive test
- Absence suggests hearing threshold >35dB

## 4. Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR)
- Evaluates auditory pathway from cochlea to brainstem
- Used in:
  - Newborn hearing screening
  - Retrocochlear pathology assessment
  - Objective hearing threshold estimation

## 5. X-ray Soft Tissue Neck (Lateral View)
- Evaluates:
  - Airway patency
  - Epiglottitis
  - Foreign bodies
  - Retropharyngeal abscess

## 6. CT Nose and Sinuses
- Essential for:
  - Chronic rhinosinusitis evaluation
  - Pre-operative planning for FESS
  - Anatomical variations assessment
  - Sinonasal tumors

## 7. CT Middle Ear and Temporal Bones
- High-resolution imaging for:
  - Cholesteatoma
  - Temporal bone fractures
  - Inner ear malformations
  - Pre-operative planning for ear surgery

## 8. Ultrasound Scan of the Neck
- Useful for:
  - Thyroid nodules
  - Cervical lymphadenopathy
  - Salivary gland pathology
  - Real-time guided FNAC

## 9. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)
- Minimally invasive diagnostic procedure
- Used for:
  - Thyroid nodules
  - Cervical lymph nodes
  - Salivary gland masses
- Can be ultrasound-guided for better accuracy

## 10. Histopathology
- Gold standard for definitive diagnosis
- Essential for:
  - Cancer diagnosis and staging
  - Inflammatory conditions
  - Benign tumors
  - Post-operative specimen analysis
