this the receding accuracy of AI models due to the fact that there is a [[what is knowledge cutoff in ai models]]


e.g. 

For instance, a fashion designer might want to track trends in spending before creating a new collection. If they use a model that was last trained on fashion trends and consumer habits from 2015, the model may not produce useful outputs because those two factors likely changed over time. Consumer preferences in 2015 are very likely to be different from today’s trends. In other words, the model’s predictions have drifted from _accurate_ at the time of training to _less accurate_ in the present day due, in part, to the model's knowledge cutoff.
