# Context

A big problem arises when i try to run within the correct environment and knowing the appropriate library is there, it keeps on saying that module is missing.

# Note

use python3 instead of python to run
(i am sure there is a way to point to the same with python and python3)

```python
python3 chat_1.py # instead of python chat_1.py
```
