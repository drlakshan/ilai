# AI as a Tool for Dissent

In addition to its creative and analytical capabilities, AI can also be a powerful tool for dissent. You can actively use AI to challenge your own conclusions and prevent groupthink by instructing it to perform a "Pre-Mortem Analysis" or act as a "Devil's Advocate."

This technique allows you to productively identify weaknesses and blind spots in your plans and strategies. By weaponizing AI for dissent, you can foster a culture of critical thinking and ensure that your decisions are robust and well-vetted.
