### Spectrum of Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders (SRBDs)
*   **Thesis:** Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders (SRBDs) represent a continuum of upper airway obstruction during sleep, ranging from simple snoring to severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
*   **Key Points:**
    *   Simple (primary) snoring is the sound from upper airway vibration without significant obstruction or sleep arousal.
    *   Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS) involves sleep fragmentation and symptoms of OSA but lacks significant oxygen desaturation.
    *   Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent partial or complete upper airway obstruction, leading to health risks.
