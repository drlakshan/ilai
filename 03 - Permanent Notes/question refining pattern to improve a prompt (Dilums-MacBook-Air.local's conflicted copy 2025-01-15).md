# Responses

e.g Hi Sampath

Thank you for sending the reports.

Your reports are OK. 

Current medical management should work. Will review as planned,

If there are any concerns please visit me at my clinic.


Thanks and best regards

Dr Lakshan

# Things I don't like
Please feel free to visit me anytime in my clinic : Reason : they will misinterpret this as an invitation for a FREE visit
I'm pleased to let you know that everything looks good. : reason : In medicine it is not apporpriate to say "Everything looks good" more appropriate would be to use a phrase vague but reassures that things are OK

# Things I like
Thank you for sharing your recent test results with me.
Let's continue with your current treatment plan, and we'll have our next review as scheduled.
