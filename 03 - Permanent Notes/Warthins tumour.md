# What Did I learn?



Second most common benign parotid tumor (Papillary Cystadenoma Lymphomatosum).

## Clinical Features
- Strong association with tobacco smoking
- Multifocal/bilateral tendency (7-10% bilateral cases)
- Predilection for parotid tail (inferior pole)
- Exceedingly low malignant transformation risk (0.3-1%)
- salivary tissues inclusions in lymph nodes germinal centers
- 50s delay contrast enhancement is seen in contrast-enhanced multi-detector CT exam

## Management Philosophy
- Active surveillance often appropriate
- Surgery indicated for symptoms or patient preference
- Lower surgical urgency compared to pleomorphic adenoma
