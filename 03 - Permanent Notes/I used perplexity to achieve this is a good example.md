I wanted to color the borders of the obsidian table in orange. I went back and forth on perplexity until I got the desired outcome. At the penultimate step, where despite many textual prompting there was no desired outcome, I took a screenshot of the situation and explained that the desired outcome is not forthcoming. And Ai apologised and corrected the code and now its working well
