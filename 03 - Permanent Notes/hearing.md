Mnemonic   
E – Eighth nerve for auditory   
C – Cochlear nuclei pathway   
O – Superior olivary nucleus   
L – Lateral lemniscus   
I – Inferior colliculus   
M – Medial geniculate body   
A – Auditory cortex.  
  
AUDITORY PATHWAY  
Inner hair cells afferent nerves which from cochlear  
nerve-> spinal ganglion (present in Rosenthal canal)->  
Fibres exit through internal acoustic meatus Dorsal  
cochlear nucleus + Ventral cochlear nucleus (Pons)  
All fibres of from dorsal and ventral cochlear nucleus  
synapse to form trapezoid body Fibres now pass  
to opposite and same side Superior olivary nucleus  
Lateral lemniscus-> Inferior colliculus-> Medial  
geniculate body-> Auditory cortex (Brodmann area 41)
