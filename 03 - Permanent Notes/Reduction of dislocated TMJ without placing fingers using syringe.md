######  Note

“With the patient in a sitting position, the physician places the syringe between the posterior upper and lower molars or gums on the affected side. The patient is asked to gently bite down and grasp the syringe as the patient is instructed to roll the syringe back and forth, resulting in the reduction of the dislocated TMJ.” ([Gorchynski et al., 2014, p. 677](zotero://select/library/items/8UCTVIAR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PN7IYFX?page=2&annotation=J768PT2C))
