## Core Definition
Clinical reasoning is the cognitive process of thinking and decision-making associated with medical practice, used to transform a patient's unstructured problem into a structured one.

## Two Conflated Families
- **Cognitive models**: Explain how clinicians *think* during history-taking
- **Communication structures**: Explain how clinicians *conduct* the interview (e.g., Calgary-Cambridge)

## Core Objective
The primary and most critical initial objective of clinical reasoning is to formulate an **accurate diagnosis**.

## Significance
Flaws in the reasoning process are:
- Leading cause of preventable patient harm
- Significant factor in medical malpractice claims

## Major Reasoning Models

This note has been atomized into focused concepts:

1. [[Hypothetico-Deductive Model]] - Analytical hypothesis-testing approach using cyclical four-stage process
2. [[Pattern Recognition and Illness Scripts]] - Intuitive expert recognition through stored mental models
3. [[Schema-Based Reasoning]] - Structured diagnostic frameworks (decision trees, flowcharts)
4. [[Bayesian Reasoning in Clinical Practice]] - Probabilistic updating using likelihood ratios
5. [[Narrative-Based Medicine]] - Patient story as foundation for data gathering
6. [[Dual-Process Theory in Clinical Reasoning]] - System 1/System 2 integration and metacognition
7. [[Cognitive Biases in Diagnosis]] - Systematic judgment errors (75% of diagnostic errors)
8. [[Teaching Clinical Reasoning]] - Educational strategies for deliberate skill development
