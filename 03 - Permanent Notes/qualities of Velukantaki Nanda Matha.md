Velukantaki Nanda Matha was an exemplary female lay disciple of the Buddha who lived in the city of Velukanta. She is mentioned in several ancient Buddhist scriptures, particularly in the Anguttara Nikaya (AN 7.53), where she is described as possessing seven remarkable qualities:

1. She had exceptional devotion and faith in the Buddha's teachings.

2. She was able to keep her thoughts pure and quickly dispel unwholesome mental states.

3. She had never deliberately broken any precepts since becoming a lay follower.

4. She could enter and remain in the four jhanas (meditative absorptions) at will.

5. She had given up the[[ five lower fetters]], indicating a high level of spiritual attainment.

6. She was known for her generosity, having founded an offering for the Buddhist order led by Sariputta and Moggallana, which the Buddha praised.

7. She had the ability to converse with powerful deities, as evidenced by her interaction with Vessavana, a great celestial king.

One notable story about her involves her recitation of the Parayana (a section of the Sutta Nipata) at dawn. The great king Vessavana, passing by, stopped to listen and praised her recitation. He then informed her that Sariputta and Moggallana would be visiting Velukanta the next day. Nanda Matha prepared offerings for them and dedicated the merit to Vessavana.

When Sariputta inquired about how she knew of their impending visit, she recounted her interaction with Vessavana. This impressed Sariputta, who remarked on the incredible nature of her ability to converse with such a powerful deity.

Velukantaki Nanda Matha's story serves as an inspiration in Buddhist tradition, showcasing the high spiritual attainments possible for lay practitioners. Her devotion, purity of mind, generosity, and spiritual accomplishments made her a model lay disciple in the early Buddhist community[1][5][7].
