A **metaphor** and an **analogy** are both figures of speech used to compare things, but they function quite differently:

### Metaphor (උපමා in Sinhala):
- **Definition:** A metaphor directly compares two unlike things by stating that one thing *is* another, without using "like" or "as." It's used to symbolically associate characteristics of one thing with another.
- **Example:** "Time is a thief." (Here, time is being compared to a thief, implying that it steals moments from our lives.)
- **Key Point:** Metaphors make an implicit comparison or equivalence between two things.

### Analogy:
- **Definition:** An analogy describes the similarities between two things, often to explain or clarify something complex by relating it to something more familiar. Unlike metaphors, analogies usually make a more detailed comparison and often include "like" or "as."
- **Example:** "Just as a caterpillar grows out of its cocoon, we must grow out of our comfort zone." (This analogy compares personal growth to a caterpillar's transformation, to clarify the concept of growth.)
- **Key Point:** Analogies tend to be more elaborate comparisons used for explanation or clarification.

### Summary of Difference:
- **Metaphor** is a direct comparison where one thing is described as being another.
- **Analogy** is a more elaborate comparison that often explains the relationship between two things by highlighting their similarities.

Metaphors are often more abstract and poetic, whereas analogies are used more in teaching or explaining by comparison.
