### Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) for Snoring and OSA
*   **Thesis:** Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is a surgical procedure to widen the oropharyngeal airway, but its long-term success is limited and it carries significant risks and complications.
*   **Key Points:**
    *   UPPP involves excising the uvula, part of the soft palate, and often the tonsils.
    *   Long-term success for snoring is low (~45%), and it has minimal impact on OSA parameters.
    *   Common complications include severe postoperative pain, velopharyngeal insufficiency, and potential worsening of sleep apnea.
    *   It may compromise future use of CPAP therapy.
