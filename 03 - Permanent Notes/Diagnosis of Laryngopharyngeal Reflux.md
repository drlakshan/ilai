### Thesis Statement

Its a clinical diagnoisis
subjective patient symptoms with endoscopic signs
low specificity 
questionable reliability
questionable reliability of these findings.

### Key Points
- The initial diagnosis of LPR is typically presumptive, based on patient history and findings from flexible or rigid laryngeal endoscopy.
- The [[Reflux Symptom Index (RSI)]]  is a validated questionnaire used to quantify symptom severity, but it is not specific to LPR as other causes of laryngeal inflammation can produce high scores.
- The [[Reflux Finding Score (RFS)]] attempts to standardize endoscopic findings like erythema and oedema, but these signs are common in the asymptomatic population, making them unreliable for a definitive diagnosis.
- Given the significant controversy and lack of a pathognomonic sign, a pragmatic approach is to use the RSI and RFS as complementary tools to support the clinical picture and monitor response to treatment, rather than as standalone diagnostic certainties.
