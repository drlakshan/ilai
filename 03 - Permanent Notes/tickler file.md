##  <font color=7FFFD4>Note</font> 
its a collection of folders 
one for each day
one for each month

every day take the folder out for that particular day and see what need to be done and pocket concert tickets or payment reminders etc and empty that by deferring to a different date, and get tomorrow's folder to the front.

Genius!
