• Optimizing Hearing Aid Settings

  - Personalize and optimize settings in real-time

  - Improve hearing outcomes in challenging environments

• Streamlining Cochlear Implant Care

  - Automate mapping and programming

  - Predict implant outcomes based on preoperative imaging

• Improving Diagnostic Accuracy

  - Analyze acoustic data (audiograms, electrophysiology measurements)

  - Analyze ear images (otoscope images, CT scans)

  - Assist general practitioners in diagnosing ear disorders

• Personalized Medicine

  - Analyze large datasets of patient data

  - Develop personalized treatment plans

  - Improve outcomes and reduce complications

• Facilitating Research

  - Analyze large acoustic datasets

  - Identify new biomarkers for hearing disorders

  - Develop new diagnostic and treatment tools

• Note: AI in otology is still in early stages

  - More research needed to validate accuracy and effectiveness

  - Ethical considerations (data privacy, algorithmic bias) must be addressed
