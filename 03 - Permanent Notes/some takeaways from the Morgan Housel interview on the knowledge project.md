## Here are a few highlights from the episode:

**If you can do something that changes your odds of an outcome, it’s not luck.**

**I think not having FOMO (fear of missing out) is the single most important financial skill.** I think it’s so important that you cannot ever imagine accumulating significant wealth over your lifetime if you are susceptible to FOMO.

My investing strategy is to own index funds for as long as I possibly can, **to be average for an above-average period of time.**

**Investing is one of the very few endeavors in life where the harder you try, the worse you’re probably going to do.**

**What’s important is that your net worth is growing faster than your aspirations.** If your aspirations are outgrowing your net worth, that’s when people get into trouble.

**Nothing that we’ve ever done in our financial life has, I think, given us more happiness than paying that mortgage off.**

**Once you stop viewing money as just trying to make the spreadsheet happy and you view it as a tool to live a better life, a lot of things change.**
