# Reference

1. Word-Level Variations: This level of abstraction involves making specific changes to the words or phrases used in the prompt to generate different options. For example, you can tweak the wording, add or remove specific details, or change the tone of the generated content.
    
2. Approach-Level Variations: This level of abstraction focuses on varying the overall approach or perspective in generating options. Instead of just modifying individual words, you can instruct the AI model to consider different approaches or techniques. For example, you can ask it to generate options from a formal or informal perspective, or from different marketing frameworks.
    
3. Technique-Level Variations: This level of abstraction involves exploring different techniques or methods for generating options. You can instruct the AI model to apply specific techniques or frameworks to generate solutions. For example, you can ask it to generate options based on different problem-solving techniques or marketing strategies.
