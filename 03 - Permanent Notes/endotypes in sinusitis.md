# Reference
“CRS is classified into CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) according to the phenotype and is divided into type 2 and non-type 2 according to the endotype [12]. As in asthma, corticosteroid therapy in CRS is effective for type 2 and CRSwNP patients, but some cases do not respond to it [13]. Eosinophilic CRSwNP was associated with higher type 2 cytokine expression, such as interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, and eotaxin. On the other hand, non-type 2 CRS had more neutrophilic inflammation and IL8 [14]. According to the results of studies about CRS endotypes and biomarkers, the medical treatment of CRS requires customization by patients, including corticosteroids, antibiotics, and biologicals [15]. Appropriate medical therapy for CRS includes a combination of treatments such as intranasal corticosteroid spray, short-term oral corticosteroids, and nasal saline irrigation. If medical treatment is ineffective, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) can be recommended [12]. Still, the role of antibiotics, including LDLT macrolides, in the treatment of CRS remains controversial.” ([Ryu et al., 2023, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/DG9XSUBY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXBUKUTZ?page=2&annotation=G7X5IXSW))
