Here are examples for each of the seven Japanese rules for discipline, applied to personal life, an ENT surgeon, and a company director.
 * Kaizen (Constant Improvement)
   * Personal: Learning a new skill by practicing for just 15 minutes every day.
   * ENT Surgeon: Reviewing and refining a single, small step of a surgical procedure after each operation to improve efficiency.
   * Company Director: Making a 1% improvement to a key business process each week, such as reducing the duration of all team meetings by one minute.
 * Ikigai (Purpose-Driven Discipline)
   * Personal: Waking up at 5 AM to exercise because your purpose is to live a long, healthy life for your family.
   * ENT Surgeon: Enduring a grueling 12-hour surgery because your purpose is to restore a patient's ability to hear or breathe.
   * Company Director: Pushing through a difficult period of company growth because your purpose is to build a company that genuinely helps people.
 * Shugyo (Austerity Training)
   * Personal: Taking a cold shower every morning to build mental toughness and get comfortable with discomfort.
   * ENT Surgeon: Spending an extra hour after a long day practicing a new, complex technique on a surgical simulator.
   * Company Director: Taking on the responsibility of a struggling, complex project to challenge your leadership and problem-solving abilities.
 * Gaman (Dignified Endurance)
   * Personal: Remaining calm and composed in the face of a difficult or frustrating conversation without complaining.
   * ENT Surgeon: Maintaining focus and precision during a long, unexpected surgical complication without showing signs of stress.
   * Company Director: Handling a public relations crisis or a major business setback with composure and dignity, rather than complaining about the situation.
 * Shikata ga nai (Acceptance of Fate)
   * Personal: Accepting that you missed a bus and immediately focusing on finding the next available option instead of getting angry.
   * ENT Surgeon: Accepting that a patient's cancer is terminal and focusing all efforts on providing the highest quality palliative care.
   * Company Director: Accepting that a competitor launched a superior product and focusing all team energy on building the next innovative solution.
 * Hansel (Relentless Reflection)
   * Personal: Writing in a journal for five minutes each evening to reflect on one thing you could have done better that day.
   * ENT Surgeon: Watching a video recording of a surgery to identify one small, actionable improvement for the next time.
   * Company Director: Ending every leadership meeting with a few minutes of reflection on how the meeting itself could have been more productive.
 * Kodawari (Uncompromising Standards)
   * Personal: Always making your bed and keeping your living space tidy, regardless of whether guests are coming over.
   * ENT Surgeon: Ensuring that every single surgical instrument is perfectly sterilized and organized, no matter how routine the procedure.
   * Company Director: Insisting that every company deliverable, from a simple email to a major product launch, meets a consistent standard of excellence.
