2022-02-28- 06:16


## Note
CT should be 0.5mm and use dicom viewer to see else you will miss the defect

MRIc accuracy is 100%. compared CT cysternogram advanced. MRIc doesnt need lumbar puncture ? is this available

[[empty sella ]]is a feature of [[Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension]]
other signs include torturous optic nerve

[[beta trace protein]] vs [[Beta 2 transferrin]]

[[corridors of endoscopic repair of CSF leaks]]

material used fat covered with [[Surgicel]]
then a piece of bone from the ethmoid dissections
fibrin glue
cartilage from the septum
fascia lata

freshening the margin this is like in myringoplasty

healing is by mucosalisation not by dural regeneration

[[Topiramate]] is very useful in IIH and most patients are on it for years and on
Is weight loss a side effect of topiramate?


this is because CSF leak can be considered nature's way of relieving pressure in the intracranial cavity. even if you repair the leak the problem remains : high ICP so they are on topiramte, acetazolamide for a long long time.
