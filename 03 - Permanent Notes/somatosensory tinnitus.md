Tinnitus can be modulated immediately by non-auditory stimulations 
There may be connections between proprioceptive and nociceptive afferents of the neck region











“More often than ever, researchers are concluding that tinnitus can be evoked or modulated by inputs from the somatosensory, somatomotor and visual–motor systems in some individuals.4–16” ([Sanchez and Rocha, 2011, p. 1089](zotero://select/library/items/Y2DI5ZNI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/A4VZXDMN?page=1&annotation=6SFWEDPT))

“his specific subgroup is called somatosensory tinnitus and it seems to be a good example of central integration of the central nervous system, because an auditory symptom like tinnitus may be modulated immediately after various non-audiology stimuli are presented.” ([Sanchez and Rocha, 2011, p. 1089](zotero://select/library/items/Y2DI5ZNI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/A4VZXDMN?page=1&annotation=3XFWKNPY))

“Some authors have reported the existence of a connection between the proprioceptive and nociceptive afferents of the neck region as well as the cochlear nucleus – something that could explain ipsilateral correlation with tinnitus in cases of muscular tension.19,20 Furthermore, Levine21 suggested that somatic stimuli can disinhibit the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus, producing the excitatory neuronal activity within the auditory pathway that results in tinnitu” ([Sanchez and Rocha, 2011, p. 1089](zotero://select/library/items/Y2DI5ZNI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/A4VZXDMN?page=1&annotation=5KXVWG6A))



“Somatosensory tinnitus should be suspected when the patient can modulate the loudness or intensity of the tinnitus with eye movements; cutaneous stimulation of skin on the hand region; through movements of the head, neck, and limb; and passive palpation of myofascial trigger points.69–73” ([Coelho et al., 2020, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/RDJYHEWQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R5H4NSZY?page=10&annotation=3F8GFQ7U))

“Clinical criteria suggesting the presence of somatic tinnitus have recently been reported,76 taking into account tinnitus characteristics and associated clinical symptoms. They include: 1. Tinnitus modulation: if movement of the head, neck, jaw, or eyes activates tinnitus modulation, use somatic maneuvers and digital pressure on myofascial trigger point. 2. Tinnitus characteristics: simultaneous appearance or intensification of tinnitus with neck or jaw complaints/pain, trauma, and bad posture. 3. Associated symptoms and signs, such as frequent pain in the cervical spine, head, or shoulder girdle; myofascial trigger points; muscle tension in the suboccipital muscles and extensor muscles of the cervical spine; temporomandibular disorders; bruxism and dental diseases.” ([Coelho et al., 2020, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/RDJYHEWQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R5H4NSZY?page=10&annotation=QL7B2VTU))




“Tinnitus Modulation A subgroup of patients with tinnitus are able to change their tinnitus perception, intensity pitch, and location as a result of some trigger activity. These   are mainly evoked with head, jaw, and eye movements or by applying pressure to a muscle in the head, neck, jaws, or a limb,69,70 and trigger-point palpation.71 These findings provide more evidence of interactions amon  the somatosensory and the auditory pathway.” ([Coelho et al., 2020, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/RDJYHEWQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R5H4NSZY?page=9&annotation=9A2CXUC4))
