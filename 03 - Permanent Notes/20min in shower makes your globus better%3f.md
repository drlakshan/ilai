######  Note

CONTEXT:




"shower for 20 mins make the symptom better"


Taking a 20-minute shower may provide temporary relief for some individuals who experience globus sensation (the feeling of a lump in the throat). The warm water and steam from a shower can help relax the muscles in the throat and neck, which may alleviate some of the discomfort associated with globus.
