"The Myth Head and facial pain secondary to sinus disease are common and should be treated primarily with antihistamines, antibiotics, steroids, and decongestants and labeled as sinus headache. The Truth Misdiagnosis of head and facial pain is common, and sinus headache is not a diagnosis. The most likely diagnosis for these patients is migraine, sometimes with concurrent sinusitis, and these patients require migraine-directed treatment."

"The medieval Latin origin of the term sinus refers to a curve, fold, or hollow [25]." ([Robblee 2021:44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TYGSW4A4?page=3))

"The paranasal sinuses can be categorized into 4 pairs: maxillary, frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses." ([Robblee 2021:45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TYGSW4A4?page=4))

"The paranasal sinus innervation originates in cranial and cervical nerves and encompasses a complex network of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve pathways." ([Robblee 2021:45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TYGSW4A4?page=4))

"The gold standard for sinusitis diagnosis is sinus CT [46]. Although these CT sinus scans are fast and widely available, CT still involves radiation exposure, and findings are often negative. A sinus CT does appear to have a good correlation to findings during functional sinus endoscopic surgery; however, in those patients with CRS symptoms, the positive predictive value of CT was only 39.9% [47, 48]. If endoscopy was used, the positive predictive value improved to 66.0%, so" ([Robblee 2021:48](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TYGSW4A4?page=7))
