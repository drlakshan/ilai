this is a note that I wrote from the mackbook air 
hoping for a fresh start
on thing I could do is to manipulate files internally so that everything syncs here.


following are the things to do
1. set up Zotero
2. set up Obsidian
3. set up Google Drive workflow
4. find a way to have continous internet ? pixel?
5. find a way to safely carry the macbook air
6. consider fragility of life feel the tingle.
