There are 5 criteria that will signify that there is more than BPPV going on:

1. Presence of other neurology
2. Nystagmus without symptoms
3. Atypical Nystagmus direction and Direction changing nystagmus
4. Poor response to treatment
5. recurrence on at least three occasions

# Revised Criteria for Suspicion of Non-Benign Positional Vertigo

## Key Points for Suspicion

1. **Association with signs or symptoms of neurological disorder**
   - Look for any accompanying neurological symptoms or signs

2. **Nystagmus without dizziness in positional diagnostic tests**
   - Presence of eye movement without the sensation of dizziness

3. **Atypical nystagmus direction**
   - Especially:
     - Downward-beating vertical nystagmus
     - Nystagmus that takes different directions in positional tests carried out at different times

4. **Poor response to therapeutic manoeuvres**
   - Symptoms persist despite appropriate treatment

5. **Recurrence (confirmed by positional tests) on at least three occasions**
   - Multiple episodes of symptoms returning

## Important Notes

- MRI of the posterior fossa is recommended when these criteria are met
- BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo) can coexist with central nervous system disorders
- These criteria help distinguish between cases that can be treated by a general practitioner and those requiring specialized care
