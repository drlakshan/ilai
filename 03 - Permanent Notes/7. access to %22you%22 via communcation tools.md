# Note

options 
	0763495665
	0717799499
	 can use whatsapp voice messages
	 this is the best number
	 and ask patients to use this and mention only messages no real time communications
	 can that be clearly mentioned at the frontend 

message patients on the booking about the instructions
like consent forms etc 
can we get the 0717799499 to whatsup web and the computer screen and send the documents immediately and can be used as a way to track them



Plan : when booking or discussing about the possibility of surgery the details are whatsapped to patients number by creating a contact in the hotline WhatsApp. Make it message only no calls.
