emission of photons

We need a medium, photon source reflector

Laser makes electrones move from one energy level to the next E1 to E2 and when relieved, it comes back to E1 emitting energy back again and based on the medium in the chamber laser is emitted. a reflector is used to create a coherent reflection and through an opening it goes out.
