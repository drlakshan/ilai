# Chapter 7: AI as a Tutor - Highlight 5

Here is an example: let's say I wanted to include a good analogy of an AI tutor in this chapter, and wanted to get help from an AI. I could simply ask for one: Tell me a good analogy for an AI tutor. And the response was a little unsatisfying: An AI tutor is like a musical metronome, because it is consistent, adaptable, and a mere tool. Now we can try applying some of these other techniques: Think this through step by step: come up with good analogies for an AI tutor. First, list possible analogies. Second, critique the list and add three more analogies. Next, create a table listing pluses and minuses of each. Next, pick the best and explain it. Here, GPT-4 considered a dozen suggestions, from personal trainer to gardener, and created a table comparing them all, before settling on a GPS system, which, much like an AI tutor, is designed to assist users in navigating unfamiliar terrain. It provides real-time feedback, adjusts recommendations based on changing conditions (e.g., traffic or construction), and offers alternative routes when the user goes off track. Similarly, an AI tutor guides students through the academic terrain, offering real-time feedback, adjusting based on the student's progress, and providing alternative learning paths when necessary. This analogy also emphasizes the idea that while the tool provides guidance, it's up to the user (or student) to drive and make the journey, reinforcing the collaborative nature of learning with AI. Much improved, due to a little prompt engineering.
