# Offloading Cognitive Load to AI

One of the most powerful applications of AI is its ability to strategically offload cognitive load. You can intentionally delegate memory-intensive and complex computational tasks to the AI, freeing up your own cognitive resources for higher-level pattern recognition, creative problem-solving, and strategic insight.

Use the AI to track multiple variables, hold competing frameworks in mind simultaneously, or manage large amounts of information. By leveraging the AI's computational power, you can augment your own cognitive abilities and achieve a state of "hybrid intelligence."
