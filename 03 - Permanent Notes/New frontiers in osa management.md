## Combined Summary of Concentric Collapse Treatments and Persistent Pediatric OSA Management

1. **Prevalence and Impact**: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) affects a significant portion of both adult and pediatric populations, with severe health implications if untreated. Persistent pediatric OSA remains a challenge even after adenotonsillectomy (AT), especially in children with risk factors like obesity and craniofacial disorders.

2. **Lifestyle and Non-Surgical Treatments**:
   - **Adults**: Weight loss, oropharyngeal exercises, and oral appliances are effective in reducing the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) by preventing airway collapse.
   - **Children**: CPAP, medical management with leukotriene inhibitors and nasal steroids, and weight management are primary non-surgical treatments, though adherence and effectiveness can vary.

3. **Surgical Treatments for Adults**:
   - **Soft Tissue Surgery**: Procedures like Expansion Sphincter Pharyngoplasty (ESP) and modified palatopharyngoplasty can significantly reduce AHI.
   - **Skeletal Surgery**: Hyoid suspension and maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) are effective but more invasive.

4. **Surgical Treatments for Children**:
   - **Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy (DISE)**: Used to guide upper airway surgery, including lingual tonsillectomy and supraglottoplasty.
   - **Other Procedures**: Septoplasty, posterior midline glossectomy, and craniofacial surgeries are options for specific anatomical issues.

5. **Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation (HGNS)**:
   - **Adults**: Emerging as a promising treatment for concentric collapse (CCC) of the airway, with ongoing trials for devices like the bilateral hypoglossal nerve stimulator (Genio®).
   - **Children**: Recently approved for children with Down syndrome aged 13-18 years with severe OSA, showing significant improvements in AHI and quality of life.

6. **Efficacy of Treatments**:
   - **Adults**: Non-surgical treatments can reduce AHI by up to 50%, while surgical options provide more significant improvements.
   - **Children**: HGNS has shown a 66% response rate in children with Down syndrome, with notable reductions in AHI.

7. **Challenges and Considerations**:
   - **Adults**: Skeletal surgeries are effective but less popular due to invasiveness and recovery time.
   - **Children**: CPAP faces challenges like low adherence and concerns about skeletal growth, while medical management must be used cautiously in children with behavioral disorders.

8. **Innovative Devices and Research**:
   - **Adults**: The bilateral hypoglossal nerve stimulator (Genio®) is under clinical trials for treating CCC.
   - **Children**: New nasopharyngeal airway devices and ongoing NIH-funded trials aim to optimize and personalize treatment strategies.

9. **Preventative Approaches**:
   - **Children**: Personalized, DISE-directed interventions may prevent persistent OSA in high-risk children, with ongoing research to validate these approaches.

10. **Multidisciplinary Approach**:
    - Both adult and pediatric OSA management require a multidisciplinary approach and shared decision-making to align treatment with patient care goals, considering the variety of available non-surgical and surgical options.
