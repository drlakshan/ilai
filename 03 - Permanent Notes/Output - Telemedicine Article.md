## Introduction

Telemedicine is the application of Information and Telecommunication technology to deliver health care. This concept is further elaborated by the World Health Organisation and concept of "digital health" is brought on to mean "the use of information and communications technology in support of health and health related fields" (Mannig and Gillespie 2022)

The common use of this technology did not however take off widely despite advances of Information technology. COVID-19 infection causing a devastating pandemic starting later 2019 and still ravaging around the world has given a "booster dose" to Telemedicine. (Mannig and Gillespie 2022)

There are disciplines of medicine extremely conducive to Telemedicine like Radiology, as PACS systems can transmit high resolution images securely and quickly across high speed networks enabling remote interpretation by the expert. It is pertinent to ask whether otolaryngology field necessitating examination into hard to access anatomic regions is suitable for Telemedicine. 

In this article we describe a single ENT care provider experience of delivering otolaryngology care using a single app (oDoc) from November 2020 to September 2021 (11 months)




## Methods

Details of the prescriptions from November 2020 to September 2021 were collected from the oDoc application database after removing patient identifiable details for privacy reasons.
Data was extracted regarding demographics, clinical features and prescription details. 
Data was analysed using Google Sheets.


## Results
Data collection period was 9 months starting from November 2021 till S
Simple statistical analysis was carried out on Google Sheets.

Number of patients : 337

Distribution of disease conditions 



Diagnositic conditions acute vs chronic

Benefits

Advantages:

1. lowered equipment cost
2. Travel costs for patients
3. unnecessary transfers to specialist centres
4. No compromise in diagnostic accuracy
5. No compromise in patient satisfaction

Limitations
1. issues of reliable Internet connection and limited access to technology and devices
3. Lack of human touch 
4. inability to examine hard to access areas and luminal structures
5. inherent need to use equipment like otoscope and endoscopes that may not be compatible with the telemedicine mode of patient care
6. lack of available equipment and poor Internet access and reliable Internet access low speed Internet access
7. privacy concerns with possible data breach and identity theft
8. Technophobia particularly in the elderly population and unfamiliarity
9. certain platforms necessitate extensive training and expensive software platforms and possible equipment purchases
10. Palpation is not available and occult masses may be missed
11. online abuse


recommendations
1. Telemedicine is a viable option to deliver healthcare in otolaryngology
2. Telemedicine is better suited for chronic medical conditions however even in acute instances, emergency guidance can be given to patients
3. There is high provider satisfaction in the provision
4. Useful in follow up care
5. With the advancement of technology particularly wearable technology, a further expansion is highly likely

Provider Satisfaction

Problems noted

# discussion
in this descriptive retrospective study we have analyzed data pertaining to a single unit experience in delivery of telemedicine for the care of ear nose throat disorders. It’s evident that it is practical to do that care in this manner and there is high provider satisfaction. Situations like pandemics (and even other similar situations where physical access to healthcare can be a challenge ) telemedicine will become a great option. As we have noted in the article there are  strengths as well
as weaknesses of telemedicine. 

With the advancement of technology and wider adaptation of telemedicine more and more service providers will opt for such services at least partly.
