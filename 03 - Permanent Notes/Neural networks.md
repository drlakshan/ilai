An arrangement in computer systems in artificial intelligence where similar to human neuronal architecture where layered processing of information happens

There are fundamental three types of layers

Input

Output

Hidden 

  

Forward propagation feeds forward and error loss is checked and fed to the next layer

Backward propagation feeds backward again for error correction

Convolutional networks uses Mathematical formula for convolution to achieve neural network function of deep learning
