what do I want 
i wan to be able to write, I want to be able to connect and I want to be able to access anywhere and every where. if i could do that with minimum disturbance then my target is achieved. I truly like how obsidian help me to document my thoughts in simple markdown format. it is universal. its this syncing issue that bugs me. I use koofr and it seem to work ok with remotely save plug in. icloud failed me because of the delay in syncing of large vaults. google drive is not natively supported. I could swap google drive to koofr but would that solve the problem? 
In my quest to conquer AI and ENT a great knowledge management system is a must. now I could switch to apple notes, or google docs etc but I dont want to do that. why? for the last 3 years I have been building up my knowledge graph with obsidian and the fact that i can link the files and create connections gives me super powers. I don't want to miss that. and it is quite disturbing to start again. In general I am open to change but the change need to be meaningful.

when I use dark theme and start typing away using the basic obsidian editor features I feel I am more productive. 

so how should I work from here. 

1. my knowledge collected in Koofr will be the foundation
2. I can download Koofr desktop to this and then I can sync it across from the internet to M1 Air and then use that as the vault for obsidian. 
3. Will setup remotely save plug in then I will be set to work from this as well. 
4. Please continue this setup for a while before experimenting any further.
