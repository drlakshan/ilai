### Patient Evaluation for Snoring and OSA
*   **Thesis:** A comprehensive evaluation, including clinical history, physical examination, and investigations like polysomnography, is crucial before any intervention for snoring and OSA.
*   **Key Points:**
    *   Clinical history should be taken from the patient and their partner, covering nocturnal and daytime symptoms.
    *   Physical examination includes BMI, neck circumference, and a detailed upper airway evaluation (nasal, oropharyngeal, and endoscopic).
    *   Sleep studies (Polysomnography) are essential to objectively determine the severity of OSA.
    *   Sleep Nasendoscopy (SNE/DISE) is valuable for identifying the specific site(s) of obstruction to guide treatment.
