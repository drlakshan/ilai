## Surgical Steps
1. **General anesthesia** with endotracheal intubation
2. **Supine positioning** of patient
3. **Boyle-Davis mouth gag** insertion for oral exposure
4. **Nasal catheter** placement through nostril to retract soft palate
5. **4mm or 2.7mm rigid nasal endoscope (0°)** insertion for visualization
6. **Surgeon positioning** on right side of patient
7. **Coblation wand** introduction through oral cavity to nasopharynx
8. **Endoscopic-guided adenoidectomy** performed under direct visualization

## Clinical Context
- Precise endoscopic technique ensuring complete adenoid visualization
- Minimally invasive approach with controlled tissue ablation
