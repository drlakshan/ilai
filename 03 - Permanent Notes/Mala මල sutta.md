I had the pleasure of learning about this particular sutra https://pitaka.lk/main?n=33115   on the way from the Dambadeniya estate. It's really pertinent in the fact that I was thinking about the practice, the word “practice”, and how it relates to my own medical practice and the practice of meditation. 

And now, based on this sutra, how the practice, or rather lack of it, will lead to deterioration of spiritual development. 
Asajjaya malan අසජ්ජාය මලං 

So, I have venerated practice as the way of work. It's not merely just work, the practice. Practice of intellect, practice of spirituality, practice of... Practice done in a proper way, like deliberate practice.
