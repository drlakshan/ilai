# Four Pillars of Migraine Lifestyle Management

## Core Concept
**Lifestyle modification** is the **cornerstone of migraine care** and forms the foundation for all other treatments.

## The Four Pillars

### 1. Sleep
- **Maintain regular sleep-wake cycle**
- **Consistent bedtime and wake time**
- **Adequate duration** (7-9 hours for most adults)
- **Sleep hygiene** practices

### 2. Diet
- **Eat regular meals** (avoid skipping meals)
- **Stay well hydrated**
- **Avoid common triggers**:
  - Caffeine (excess or withdrawal)
  - Alcohol
  - Aged cheeses
  - Processed foods with additives

### 3. Exercise
- **Regular, moderate aerobic exercise**
- **Preventive effect** on migraine frequency
- **Avoid excessive intensity** (can trigger attacks)
- **Consistent routine**

### 4. Stress Management
- **Mindfulness techniques**
- **Yoga and meditation**
- **Relaxation training**
- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**
- **Biofeedback**

## Clinical Implementation

### Patient Education
- **Foundation of treatment**: Emphasize importance
- **Individualized approach**: Tailor to patient's lifestyle
- **Gradual implementation**: Start with one pillar
- **Tracking progress**: Use headache diaries

### Evidence Base
- **Strongest evidence**: Sleep and stress management
- **Moderate evidence**: Diet and exercise
- **Synergistic effect**: All four pillars work together

## Behavioral Therapies

### Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
- **Develops coping strategies**
- **Addresses anxiety and maladaptive habits**
- **Reduces migraine frequency**

### Biofeedback
- **Teaches physiologic control**
- **Muscle tension and skin temperature**
- **Strong evidence for prevention**

## Clinical Pearls
1. **Start with lifestyle** before medications
2. **Address all four pillars** for maximum benefit
3. **Use headache diaries** to track improvement
4. **Individualize triggers** for each patient
