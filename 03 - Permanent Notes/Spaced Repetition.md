“Probably the most robust effects of spacing occur in improved rote memory for the studied material. Across 254 studies comparing massed versus spaced practice on later memory for verbal information (e.g., words, sentences, facts, passages), overall, spaced practice dominated massed practice in recall performance” ([“Kang, S. H. K. (2016). Spaced Repetition Promotes Efficient and Effective Learning. Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 3(1), 12–19. doi:10.1177/2372732215624708”, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/78R2GI2E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AUNMJFTV?page=2&annotation=EEVEI8GL))
