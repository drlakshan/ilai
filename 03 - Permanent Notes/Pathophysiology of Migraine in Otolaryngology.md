# Pathophysiology of Migraine in Otolaryngology

The modern understanding of migraine is that of a complex neurobiological disorder characterized by a state of neuronal hyperexcitability and altered sensory processing (a "sensitive brain"). This framework explains the diverse otologic, vestibular, and sinonasal symptoms seen in ENT practice.

## Core Mechanisms
*   **Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD)**: A slow wave of neuronal depolarization across the cerebral cortex, which is the electrophysiological basis for the migraine aura. It is hypothesized to cause vestibular symptoms when it propagates through the vestibular cortex.
*   **Trigeminal Vascular System (TVS) Activation**: The trigeminal nerve endings innervating intracranial blood vessels are activated, triggering the release of neuropeptides and causing neurogenic inflammation, which is the substrate for migraine pain.
*   **Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP)**: A key neuropeptide and potent vasodilator that mediates nociceptive signaling. Its release during an attack is central to the pain and other symptoms of migraine, making it a primary therapeutic target.

## Links to ENT Symptoms
*   **Trigamino-Vestibulocochlear Reflex**: Trigeminal activation can cause CGRP release and neurogenic inflammation within the inner ear, producing vertigo, tinnitus, and aural fullness.
*   **Trigamino-Autonomic Reflex**: Trigeminal activation stimulates parasympathetic outflow, causing nasal congestion and clear rhinorrhea, mimicking sinusitis.
*   **Central Sensitization**: The hyperexcitable state of the brain lowers the threshold for sensory stimuli, leading to photophobia, phonophobia, and motion sensitivity.
