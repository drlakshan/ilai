There is a forum discussion on this topic in the American academy 

“I am interested in how others are counseling regarding thyroid nodules and Semaglutide, et al.  I have a patient who underwent hemithyroidectomy for suspicious nodule which confirmed NIFTP and has multiple sub-cm nodules on the contralateral side which we are monitoring with ultrasound. “

She came to her check up asking for clearance from her PCP to use Semaglutide for weight loss.  She is a pre-diabetic on metformin.  As far as I know, the thyroid cancers were found in rodents and not humans but in light of her known, albeit low risk pathology, I was hesitant to give her a green flag to proceed.
