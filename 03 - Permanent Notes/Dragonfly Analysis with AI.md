# Dragonfly Analysis with AI

Orchestrating a "Dragonfly Analysis" involves using AI to simulate and integrate multiple expert perspectives on a complex problem. This approach, inspired by [[Dragonfly Thinking]], allows you to create a holistic, 360-degree view and avoid the critical blind spots that come with siloed thinking.

By prompting the AI to act as different personas (e.g., an economist, a security expert, a social critic), you can generate a diverse range of insights and identify potential risks and opportunities that might otherwise be missed. This technique transforms the AI from a simple information retriever into a powerful analytical partner.
