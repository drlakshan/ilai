“Results Relative to stable weight, a 10% weight gain predicted an approximate 32% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20%-45%) increase in the AHI. A 10% weight loss predicted a 26% (95% CI, 18%-34%) decrease in the AHI. A 10% increase in weight predicted a 6-fold (95% CI, 2.2-17.0) increase in the odds of developing moderateto-severe SDB.” ([Peppard et al., 2000, p. 3015](zotero://select/library/items/J9775UKE)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DMIJE2WE?page=1&annotation=HGB2HUZU))
