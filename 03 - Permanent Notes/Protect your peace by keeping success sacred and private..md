This is a great starting point to the “ Revolution”

I need to work hard and in silence
And remember true confidence comes from internal validation not from external applause 
Let’s pause a bit here
This is exactly opposite to what I have been doing 
I was using positive experiences that I had with patients to boost my morale. Even received praises for my lectures etc also made me positive. [[HEAL frame work of making learning stick]]

But if I can become my own cheerleader? The problem is I am too self critical at times having imposter syndrome as well

I think I need to glow up internally 
Now that I have got the physical ailments fixed (at least for the moment) now I can focus I. The rest of the development. I want to be able to achieve mahaggatha Chiththa as early as possible I am using the environmental clues like the up coming Vesak celebration to reach those mile stones.

karaneeya metta sutta is a great central point I want to utilize.
