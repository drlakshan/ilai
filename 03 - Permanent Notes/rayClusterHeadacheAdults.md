“Cluster headache is characterised by attacks of very severe, unilateral headache lasting 15–180 minutes, up to eight times per day. The attacks are associated with cranial autonomic symptoms on the same side and a sense of agitation or restlessness.” (Ray et al., p. 15)
“First-line acute abortive treatments include intranasal or subcutaneous sumatriptan or high-flow oxygen. Neuromodulation may benefit some patients.” (Ray et al., p. 15)
“First-line preventive therapy is high-dose verapamil. Close monitoring is required for the adverse effect of arrhythmia.” (Ray et al., p. 15)
“emerging therapies that have either proven efficacy, or possible benefit for cluster headache. They include drugs aimed at the calcitonin gene-related peptide.” (Ray et al., p. 15)
“All patients presenting with cluster headache require MRI of the brain, including the pituitary region to exclude a secondary cause mimicking cluster headache (‘symptomatic cluster headache’). These include vascular causes, inflammatory pathology or a neoplasm.9” (Ray et al., p. 15)
“It responds to a trial of indometacin (25 mg three times a day then increasing, if there is no or only a partial effect, at three-day intervals to 50 mg, then 75 mg three times a day with gastric ulcer prophylaxis).10 The gastric ulcer prophylaxis is stopped when the indometacin is stopped.” (Ray et al., p. 15)
“colloquially as the ‘suicide headache’” (Ray et al., p. 15)
“The pooled lifetime prevalence of cluster headache is 0.12%.” (Ray et al., p. 15)
“Attacks are triggered by the interplay of endogenous and exogenous factors such as alcohol and seasonal and diurnal variation. Smoking is a well-known risk factor in chronic cluster headache.6” (Ray et al., p. 15)
“Cluster headache accounts for 20% of headaches which always occur on the same side of the head (side-locked headache).” (Ray et al., p. 15)
“An anterior location of pain, sense of internal restlessness or agitation, and ipsilateral autonomic features (conjunctival injection, lacrimation, rhinorrhoea, eyelid oedema, sweating, miosis or ptosis) are highly suggestive of one of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias.” (Ray et al., p. 15)
“These are the: • trigeminovascular system • parasympathetic system • hypothalamus.12” (Ray et al., p. 16)
“Activation of the trigeminal system results in release of several neuropeptides including calcitonin gene-related peptide, a potent vasodilator, through activation of transient receptor potential cation subfamily V1 (TRPV1).5,13” (Ray et al., p. 16)
“First-line, evidence-based, abortive treatments for cluster headache include triptans and high-flow 100% oxygen through a well-fitting mask (Table 1).5,15-21” (Ray et al., p. 17)
“ubcutaneous or intranasal preparations are recommended for their rapid onset of action.” (Ray et al., p. 17)
“Despite a lack of supportive randomised data, prednisolone is commonly used as a bridging preventive strategy to allow the up-titration of safer long-term preventive therapies.” (Ray et al., p. 18)
“Starting at 1 mg/kg (maximum dose 75 mg daily) with gastric ulcer prophylaxis, and down-titrating over two weeks, is one reasonable strategy.15,16” (Ray et al., p. 18)
“An alternative strategy is a greater occipital nerve block with an injection of local anaesthetic and depotmethylprednisolone.” (Ray et al., p. 18)
“Immediate-release or controlledrelease verapamil is first line, and its use is supported by a randomised controlled trial, in which 80% of patients had a halving of attack frequency and 26% were attack free.25” (Ray et al., p. 18)
“One in five patients will develop an arrhythmia and delayed-onset arrhythmias have been reported” (Ray et al., p. 18)
“Once a bout of cluster headache has finished, the patient can be weaned cautiously off verapamil, by 80 mg every one to two weeks.” (Ray et al., p. 18)
“Drug Dosing Monitoring Possible adverse effects Possible mechanism of action Verapamil (immediate-release formulation*) (Grade 1B) Start: 80 mg three times a day for at least 2 weeks Titrate: increase by 80 mg every 2 weeks Range: 240–960 mg ECG: before starting and at every dose change Repeat at stable dose after 10 days, every 1–2 months then every 6 months Constipation, peripheral oedema, bradycardia, conduction abnormalities. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor. There is a potential for drug interactions Voltage-gated calcium channels: decreases calcitonin gene-related peptide release, alters” (Ray et al., p. 18)
“Topiramate showed efficacy in a single open-label trial, but while it is a reasonable third-line option, cognitive adverse effects may limit its use.29” (Ray et al., p. 19)
“Electrical stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion, occipital nerve and vagal nerve have all been effective at reducing attack frequency.” (Ray et al., p. 19)
“n a randomised controlled trial of sphenopalatine ganglion neurostimulation (involving implantation of a device not available in Australia) for refractory cluster headache, 67% of patients achieved pain relief.31” (Ray et al., p. 19)
“Galcanezumab is a monoclonal antibody against calcitonin gene-related peptide.” (Ray et al., p. 19)
“Three prospective studies of onabotulinum toxin A using a variety of protocols have provided low-quality evidence that it may reduce attack frequency in cluster headache by up to 50%.3” (Ray et al., p. 19)
