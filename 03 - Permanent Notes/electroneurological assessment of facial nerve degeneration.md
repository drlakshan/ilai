# What Did I learn?

1. less than 90 % degeneration 3-14 days later conservative management
2. Never done before 72 hours
3. ENoG EMG works as a functional filter to decide on facial nerve decompression








# Context:

I had a foreigner who had a skull base fracture with delayed facial nerve palsy.






## References

Electrophysiological testing serves as the **Cornerstone of Decision-Making** in the diagnostic stratification and management of post-traumatic facial palsy, particularly Delayed Post-Traumatic Facial Palsy (DP-TFP). It is deemed indispensable because it provides **objective data** necessary to determine the prognosis and establish candidacy for surgical decompression.

In the larger context of Clinical Evaluation and Diagnostic Stratification, electrophysiology acts as the "functional filter" or the **objective metric** that guides the transition from the preferred conservative management pathway to urgent surgical intervention.

### I. Electroneurography (ENoG): The Acute Surgical Trigger

**Electroneurography (ENoG)** is the primary electrodiagnostic tool used to assess facial nerve integrity and is crucial for guiding acute treatment decisions.

#### 1. Critical Timing

For ENoG results to accurately reflect the degree of axonal degeneration (Wallerian degeneration), the test must be performed within a critical timeframe, typically **3 to 14 days** after the onset of paralysis. Clinically, ENoG or Electromyography (EMG) should not be arranged **before 72 hours** after onset. Many centers use serial ENoG, repeating the test at approximately 7 and 14 days to trend the level of degeneration.

#### 2. Decision Thresholds for Management

The interpretation of ENoG results is central to stratifying the management protocol. ENoG measures the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential on the affected side relative to the healthy, contralateral side.

 **Conservative Management:** If ENoG demonstrates **partial degeneration (less than 90% loss)**, the nerve is considered salvageable through conservative measures, such as aggressive steroid therapy.

## Key Clinical Pearls from Related Notes:

### **ENoG Decision-Making Framework:**
- **Timing**: Never before 72 hours, optimal 3-14 days after onset
- **Threshold**: >90% degeneration = surgical consideration
- **<90% degeneration**: Conservative management with steroids
- **Serial ENoG**: Repeat at 7 and 14 days to trend degeneration

### **Steroid Protocols (From Related Notes):**
- **Methylprednisolone**: 1mg/kg/day tapered over 2 weeks
- **ENT-UK option**: Prednisolone 60mg/d for 5 days
- **High-dose aggressive therapy** required for DP-TFP
- **Purpose**: Reduce edema and inflammation within facial canal

### **Surgical Landmarks (8 Techniques Documented):**
1. **Tragal pointer**: 1-1.5cm anterior and inferior
2. **Tympanomastoid suture line**: 6-8mm medial or deep
3. **Bisecting posterior belly of digastric and skull base**
4. **Retrograde from peripheral branch**
5. **Superficial to styloid process**
6. **Anterograde dissection after mastoidectomy**
7. **Transverse process of axis as landmark**
8. **Midpoint technique**: Between mastoid tip and bony-cartilaginous junction of EAC

### **Assessment Tools Integration:**
- **eFACE**: Electronic facial paralysis assessment (16-item visual analogue scale)
- **House-Brackmann scale**: Standard grading system
- **Corneal protection**: Absolute priority in facial palsy management

### **Clinical Context from Related Notes:**
