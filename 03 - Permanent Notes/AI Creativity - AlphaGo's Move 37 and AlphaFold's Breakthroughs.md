AI Creativity: Challenging Human Dogma in Go and Science
The development of advanced AI systems like AlphaGo and AlphaFold provides compelling evidence that artificial intelligence is capable of genuine creativity and discovery, moving beyond mere computation to establish new, superior knowledge.

1. AlphaGo and the Strategic Breakthrough: Move 37 ♟️
• The Move: In 2016, during Game 2 against Go champion Lee Sedol, AlphaGo played Move 37—a highly unconventional placement that professional human commentators initially dismissed as a foolish mistake (a 1 in 10,000 probability for a human master).
• AI Logic: The move was a deeply strategic maneuver, prioritizing long-term board influence and maximizing the probability of winning over immediate, traditional territorial gains. It was a strategy learned entirely through self-play and reinforcement learning, unconstrained by centuries of human Go heuristics.
• Impact: Move 37 challenged and ultimately expanded human understanding of Go, demonstrating a level of strategic insight previously inaccessible to the world's best players. It led to a revolution in professional Go as players adopted and studied the AI’s innovative techniques.


2. AlphaFold and the Scientific Breakthrough: Protein Folding 🧬
• The Problem: The protein folding problem (determining a protein's 3D structure from its amino acid sequence) was a 50-year grand challenge in biology due to the astronomically large search space (often compared to "Googolplex" complexity).
• AI Solution: AlphaFold (and the subsequent AlphaFold 2) used a novel deep learning architecture to predict protein structures with near-experimental accuracy, effectively solving the problem.
• Impact: This AI breakthrough accelerates drug discovery and biological understanding globally. The public release of the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AlphaFold DB), containing over 200 million predicted structures, acts as an unparalleled scientific accelerator, demonstrating AI's capacity to democratize and generate fundamental new knowledge.
