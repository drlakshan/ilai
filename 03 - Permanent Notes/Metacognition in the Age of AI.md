# Metacognition in the Age of AI

Success in the AI era is determined by your ability to "think about thinking." This practice, known as metacognition, involves actively analyzing your own cognitive biases while developing an intuition for the inherent biases and operational patterns of the AI models you are partnering with.

By being aware of your own mental models and the AI's potential limitations, you can better evaluate the outputs you receive and avoid being misled by plausible-sounding but incorrect information. This critical self-awareness is essential for effective human-AI collaboration.
