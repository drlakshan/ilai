# What Did I learn?


1. specific point mutation in BRAF gene
2. activates MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway - constitutive activation
3. commonest genetic alteration
	1. papillary : 40-60%
	2. anaplastic : 20-25% : de-differentiation of a pre-existing BRAF-mutated PTC
	3. Follicular : characteristically ABSENT
		1. if present histo becomes follicular variant of PTC






# Context:

studying molecular genetics of thyroid cancer using AI, deepresearch moded of gemini and chatGPT , notebookLM and CLI tools claude code and gemini CLI
