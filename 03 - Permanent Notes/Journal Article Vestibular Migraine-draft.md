# Results

A diagnosis of Vestibular migraine is not commonly made with confidence. This is partly because the condition is less well known among clinicians. It is also mis diagnosed as a pure vestibular disorder and as a result appropriate therapy is not instituted.

[[How do you develop a diagnositc criteria]]

There are reports of this diagnosis as early as 131 AD. Aretaues of Cappodocia is credited with the first description of vestibular migraine. 

[[@lauritsenCurrentTreatmentOptions2017]]


It was seen that in patients with Migraine, there were vestibular symptoms that cannot be attibuted to known vestibular syndrome such as Menniere's disease. 

>Additionally, although some patients with migraine have vertigo as a premonitory symptom, the vertigo cannot often be characterised as an aura because of its duration or temporal association with headache. Thus, with present International Headache Society classiﬁcation criteria, the vestibular symptoms of many patients with migraine would be deemed unrelated to migraine. However, most migraine patients with vestibular symptoms do not have a recognised independent vestibular disorder such as Ménière’s disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or vestibular neuritis. As a result, many patients with both migraine and vestibular symptoms do not have a speciﬁc diagnosis to account for their vestibular symptoms."

With this need, Nuehauser and collegues propsed a set of diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine. These became popular as Nuehauser Criteria.



> The authors prospectively evaluated 200 consecutive patients from a dizziness clinic and 200 patients from a migraine clinic for migrainous vertigo based on the following criteria: 1) recurrent vestibular symptoms (rotatory/positional vertigo, other illusory self or object motion, head motion intolerance); 2) migraine according to the criteria of the International Headache Society (IHS); 3) at least one of the following migrainous symptoms during at least two vertiginous attacks: migrainous headache, photophobia, phonophobia, visual or other auras; and 4) other causes ruled out by appropriate investigations. In addition, the authors compared the prevalence of migraine according to the IHS criteria in the dizziness clinic group with a sex- and age-matched control group of 200 orthopedic patients.

International Classification of Headache disorders Beta version 3 have published consensus diagnositc criteria. [@zaleski-kingVestibularMigraineIts2021]

Althogh these criteria are published a quite number of these patiens are misdiagnosed and mismanaged. 
As migranuers are known to have psychological disturbances like anxiety, delayed diagnosis and improper management causes rise in their psychosocial morbidity.


[@liVestibularMigraine2019]

>Anxiety and depression are significantly associated with vestibular migraine, 3 and lack of timely diagnosis not only adds to the psychological burden of the condition but also contributes to development of chronic vestibular symptoms. In a prospective study of patients with various vestibular disorders, patients with vestibular migraine—and not those with vestibular neuronitis or benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo—had significantly increased incidences of developing anxiety and phobic disorder (odds ratio 26.6), which was unrelated to degree of vestibular dysfunction on neurophysiological testing. The authors hypothesised that this may be due to the unpredictable course of the condition. Patients often perceive panic-like anxiety during episodes, which may be misdiagnosed as panic attacks while the diagnosis of vestibular migraine is overlooked.

Key things to remember
headache criteria
vestibular criteria
and when vestibular symptoms present migraine symptoms should be present


Clincal features that are most important

History is the key to diagnosis. symptoms that arise suspicion are severe disabling headche, nasuea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia in addition to vertigo.



 Additional pointers that may be important
 1. motion sickness
 
  in a study of 131 migranuers and 50 control group, motion sickness was signifcantly more prevelant in migranuers than the control (89% vs 45%) and even among them when vestibular migraine was present.  [@liVestibularMigraine2019]
  
  In another study by Kayan et al, 50% migraine population has reported motion sickness.

[@kayanNeurootologicalManifestationsMigraine1984]

> Significantly, 50 per cent had a history of motion sickness and 81 per cent experienced phonophobia <

  
  2. Vestibular March
  Childhood balance disorders tend to take a step wise progression approach. Starting from benign paroxysmal torticolis of childhookd (BPTC), moving on to benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC), to vestibular migraine in the adulthood

3. Three item ID-Migraine questionnaire

In diagnosing migraine questionnaires are important [[add-reference]]. However thay should not be very time consuming for obvious reasons. ID-migraine questionnaire study found three item questionnaire of 
1. disability
2. nausea 
3. light sensitivity
 to be 81% sensitive and 75% specific for the diagnosis of migraine as judged by IHC criteria
 [@liptonSelfadministeredScreenerMigraine2003]
  

4. Phonophobia Osmophobia Photophobia allodynia

5. Auditory symptoms

6. triggers

>"Asking for migraine-specific precipitants of vertigo attacks may provide valuable diagnostic information; for example, provocation by menstruation, deficient sleep, excessive stress, specific foods, and sensory stimuli (eg, bright or scintillating lights, intense smells, or noise)." ([Lempert 2019:697](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DTJFGWYU?page=3))

Prognosis

A 9 year followup showed that 90% patients to be still symptomatic at the end of the observed period. Frequency of the episodes and the severty however has been reduced

# Discussion

very common problem
needs attention as missed
great suffering
mis diagnosing
and mis mangement
likely to become commoner diagnosis in the future

key diagnostic indicators

key management options

Failed to show
Metaprolol 95mg daily didnt help
(Bayer et al., 2019)

# Recommendations

Increased awareness

further attention on management
