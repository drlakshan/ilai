		1. The instructor provides examples of how feedback can be obtained using ChatGPT, such as refining questions and getting feedback on them, decomposing questions into more specific ones, and challenging our own assumptions by acting as an entrenched skeptic.
	7. question refinement pattern
			1.1. Start with a question: Begin by asking a question related to the problem or topic you're exploring.
			1.2 Refine the question: After asking the initial question, the instructor suggests that we refine it to make it clearer and more specific. This refinement helps us focus on the key aspects of the problem and avoid ambiguity.
			1.3 Seek feedback on the refined question: Once we have refined the question, we can ask ChatGPT or another person if the refined question is better and if they should answer it instead. This step allows us to receive feedback on our question and learn from it.
			**Whenever I ask you a question, you will suggest a better version of my question that is clearer and more specific and ask me if you should answer it instead."**
