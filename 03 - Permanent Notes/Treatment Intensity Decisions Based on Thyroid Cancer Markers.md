# What Did I learn?


Escalation and De-escalation stratergies can be made based on these markers [[BRAF-TERT Mutation Synergy in Thyroid Cancer]]

# De-escalation indicators
1. NIFTP [[Non Invasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary like Nuclear Features NIFTP]].
2. RAS-mutant encapsulated tumors avoid overtreatment
3. Minimal vascular invasion FTC


# Escalation Triggers
1. **BRAF^V600E/TERT-mutant PTC**: Aggressive Surgery and Lymph Node Dissection
2. Tall Cell variant PTC : Enhanced surgical approach
3. Extensive vascular invasion of FTC 

# Hereditary Considerations
1. Germline RET muations : risk-stratified prophylactic thyroidectomy timing
2. M918T C634 mutations : early interventions
3.
