"In the Epley maneuver, the patient was seated on examination table and head was rotated 45° toward affected side and quickly moved patient in supine position with head extended 30° causing movement of debris, inducing an attack. Then patient's head was rotated 45° towards unaffected side, then trunk was rotated towards unaffected side in such a way that patient's nose will be pointing towards floor, causing further movement of the debris downward toward the exit to the canal, resulting in more vertigo and nystagmus. Each position should be maintained for 2 min or at least until the provoked vertigo and nystagmus subsides. The final uprighting of the patient causes the debris to enter the utricle [7]."

"In [[Semont maneuver]] patient was seated on examination table with legs hanging then head was rotated 45° horizontally toward the unaffected ear. After that patient was tilted 105° so that patient was lying on the side of the affected ear with patient's head hanging and nose pointed upward. Patient remains in this position for around 3 min—allowing debris to move to the apex of the ear canal. Then patient was moved quickly from the seated position, holding patient's head in place, until patient was lying on the side of the unaffected ear with patient's nose pointed to the ground. Patient remains in this position for 3 min allowing the debris to move toward the exit of the ear canal. Then patient was moved slowly back to the seated position. The debris should fall into the utricle of the canal, where it will no longer cause vertigo sensation" ([Gupta 2019:100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/37DJH5U4?page=2))

"Brandt-Daroff exercise were performed using standard method, in which the patient is in the sitting position on examination table, the patient moves into the lying position on the affected side on the shoulder, with the head angled upward with about 45°. The patient stays in this for 30 s and then goes back to the sitting position, looks forward, and remains in this position for 30 s as well. The patient repeats the same procedure for the other side, too. The patient performs this maneuver 5-10 times, thrice a d" ([Gupta 2019:100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/37DJH5U4?page=2))
