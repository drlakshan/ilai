progressive loss of senses hearing and vision
there are three types

first type is severe
type 2 moderate
types 3 mild




| **Type**   | **Hearing Loss**                                                  | **Vision Loss**                                                       | **Balance Issues**                 | **Associated Genes**              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Type 1** | Profound hearing loss or deafness at birth                        | Night blindness starts before age 10, severe vision loss by adulthood | Severe balance problems from birth | MY07A, USH1C, CDH23, PCDH15, SANS |
| **Type 2** | Moderate to severe hearing loss at birth (hearing aids effective) | Night blindness in late adolescence, slower progression               | Normal balance                     | USH2A, VLGR1, WHRN                |
| **Type 3** | Normal hearing at birth, progressive hearing loss in teens        | Night blindness starts in adolescence, legal blindness by midlife     | Normal to near-normal balance      | USH3A                             |

This table provides a clear comparison of the key characteristics of each type of Usher syndrome, including hearing loss, vision loss, balance issues, and associated genes.
