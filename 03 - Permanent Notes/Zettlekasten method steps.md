1. when you get an idea write it down somewhere - fleeting notes to INBOX
	your own words - no copy pasting
	mention source

2.  from INBOX create flashcards
	1. keep all flashcards in the same folder
	2. ID using zettlekasten add on may be superfluous or is it?
	3. create links to other notes as much as possible
	4. keep them small - if going beyond - break it to many
	5. tags as a drawyer 
		someone said tag can be never be a note
		complete the sentence " this note is ABOUT X Y Z"
			tags also can be thought of as entry ways to the zettlekastern
	6. make sure to include bibliography
