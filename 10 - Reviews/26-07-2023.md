Thoughts:

Got up at 4:45 and went to Maha Stupa with Harish, it was a very pleasant experience. I worshipped, meditated and re established the connection. I offered Arogya App to Maha stupa and my life to Lord Buddha. Delivered the lecture [[06 - Academic Database Folder/Academic Database Folder/Vertigo Management - a Focus New Developments and Best Practices Anuradhapura Clinical Society Lecture July 2023]] and listened to many podcasts and rekindled the reading habit a bit. exercised and slept with the intention to get up at 4:30. Life changing day.
