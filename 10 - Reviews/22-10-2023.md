## Clinical work
	Tracheostomy adjustment
------------------------------------------------------------------------



Thoughts:

its time. Lets move forward. Lets freeze experimenting. Lets use whatever we have and whatever we know. I believe I have enough to progress rapidly. Today was a great day. Helped the tracheostomy patient to get the tube again. It taught me great lessons. [[lessons learnt from the patient who had multiple tube dislodgements]]


I also thought about how I should progress in life. 
Principled life with [[Character development.canvas|Character development]] ,  [[My 5 principles and practices of character building]]


What I need to do now is this. 
Lets take it slowly. Lets flow. Lets thrive - slowly. 
I don't want to rush. Lets develop with the facilities that I already have. 
Limit the software use. Limit the hardware use. 
Make sure I recover well.
I think now I have the ability and the know how as to how to do this.
