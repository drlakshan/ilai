Thoughts:

[[chatGPT and AI based improvements in my life - the continuous log book]]
Did some minor tweaks to my PMS, came to crescat Kaffe coffeeshop. now typing this away. 

I need to slow down man. reflection on to how things are moving in this world of mine has to happen. I am having another Anuradhapura visit. this time coupled to ACS lecture. Whatever the short comings the organising committee has, my purpose is different and I am planning to achieve something different. This time around it is my mental development. 

What I have realised is now my practice is ok. I have the IT backed with Health.Lk Google Workspace. Now the workflow is smooth. Still takes about 6 minutes per patient. however I think it will be faster with marginal gains. main time consumer is the authorisation bit.
