Thoughts:


I had the best ever birthday
7 squared = 49
Wishes of loved ones, coworkers and strangers

one special thing is Ovindi's card. this card meant the whole world for me. It made my day, my life and my entire existence. 

I made sure the cakes I got to be distributed among the patients. I gave cakes and tips to people. (as I usually do).

I spent quality time with my family. 

Used chatGPT inside the obsidian vault and almost finished an entire oration. 
(want to try that with chatGPT plus subscription as well) What i realised is that, it can create a nice outline and suggested words and expressions but the quality of the information is poor. This where the Zotero and Scispace comes in. Quality research need to be accessed differently.
