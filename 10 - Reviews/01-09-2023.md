Thoughts:

A new month and persistent improvement of thinking and working. refining the Arogya Platform to improve on 2 things
1. avoiding authentication repeatedly
2. updating scripts universally even for the older ones
[[Roadmap for my pms]]


Another important thing that need to consider is the way I handle clinical work. patients with demanding medical situations, sometimes triggers me off. But I need to guard myself with metta. I need to weather these turbulent situations with Buddha like calmness. After all, the years of training is for that. So how should I view my clinical work? I think the view of service would be the best way to think. service cum meritorious act. 

Another point. discussion with Indu Asanka. He says there is ample opportunity for those who want to give service in the Universities as all others have left! An opportunity to explore!
