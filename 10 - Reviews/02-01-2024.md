# Thoughts:

Need to develop a method to review the important events in the past in life.

I am considering following
Create A simple template where I can concentrate on my writing only additionally, create couple of tags, including merits, and significant event 

while watching couple of YouTube videos I got following ideas tracker using tracker community plug-in and create questions daily questions that we need to ask things like did I learn something today did I spiritually grow today? Did I love my family today and give rating from one to 10 and then have a personal retreat is sort of a thing that I’ve been contemplating for a long while and I think I can at least modify this tip to suit my needs. 

lets do some experiments with tracker plugin
