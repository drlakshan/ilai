Thoughts:

It was a wonderful experience. We (there were 5-6 nurses, Sulochana , Miyurangi and at the end of the program Apsara, Sudu Duwa and Apsi Amma joined). We were blessed by the chief monk in the Dhathu Mandeeraya which is a rare and cherishable moment. 

In my quest to do death cleaning, this is a apt start.
