Thoughts:

when the competitiveness increases in the workplace it is easy to get swayed away from the course. In my practice over the years there is a particular way I work. I keep the head down and work. I improve myself and let my work do the talking. What I realised is that there is always this need for approval from others and there is this constant anxiety that plagues me when it comes to clinical care. what I need to develop is an attitude where I am unshaken by the outside world and develop a unshakable mind.
