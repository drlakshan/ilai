## Direction:

Great revelation on chatGPT


today i actually practice a patient conversation with chatGPT
I asked it whether it can help me to become a great communicator in medicine and it offered following

1. vocabulary building
2. role playing 
3. pronunciation practice
4. listening comprehension
5. feedback and correction
6. cultural nuances


I then role played about a patient with rhinitis and it gave a great feedback.
this is deliberate practice [[deliberate practice]]
