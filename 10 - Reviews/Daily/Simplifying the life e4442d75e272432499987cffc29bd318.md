What I need to do now is to try and improve the utilization of what I already have. 

I really need to minimize the use of gadgets let’s say I will resort to using only the iPhone and the MacBook I intentionally will keep away from the iPad to Kindle or any other electronic devices I hope that strategy will help me to get the best out of MacBook Air and the iPhone and I’ll be in a state of relaxed mind what I don’t want to happen is to do many things with the gauges that I have so the work that I do on a particular machine is going to be limited. 

For for reading I prefer MacBook

For other communication needs i will use iPhone with dual Packages

Nothing else for the next month.
