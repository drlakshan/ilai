# Parotidectomy

Date: April 7, 2021
Signicant Event: No

I did it. It was a stressful surgery. In preparing for this I took great trouble. read about it, drew it, watched a video on it. Got the nerve monitor set up. Akram's contribution was immense. I did it, found the facial nerve trunk, branches and delivered the tumour without breaking in to it. No facial nerve palsy. That was a great relief and sense of accomplishment. However, once achieved now I think that its not a big deal ! While actually it is!
