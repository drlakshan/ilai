# Approaching 4th Year at Nawaloka

Date: April 22, 2021
Signicant Event: No

On the first of May 2021, I will officially commemorate 4th year work anniversary at Nawaloka. In any-other unit in the government sector I would have to move out next year. Because of my decision to choose Nawaloka as my end station, I am able to plan my life and lead a simpler life. 

I went through simple note application and found this:

Why I will hate Nawaloka

I don't see many patients as I would've like to

I don't operate as many as at KP

I get belittled by the seniors

I don't progress

These were my concerns at the onset of carrier at Nawaloka. At 4 year mark how relevant are those?

I see on average 25 patients a day. I do a significant number of surgeries that is equal if not higher than I did in the government sector. Seniors tried and failed. I have had publications and there is academic and surgical development too. MOST importantly there is spiritual improvement i.e meditation listening to profound Dhamma etc. 

I am planning to review my 4 years in many aspects with a view to improve next four years of my carrier. [Four year reflection 2017 to 2021 May](../../Four%20year%20reflection%202017%20to%202021%20May%20dab20538105640c5becb7e2c346ccc33.md)
