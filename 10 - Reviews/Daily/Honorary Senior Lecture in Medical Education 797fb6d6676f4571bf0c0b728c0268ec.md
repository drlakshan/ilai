# Honorary Senior Lecture in Medical Education

Date: December 22, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Got the most anticipated news of the year! I am now officially an Honorary Senior Lecturer attached to University of Kelaniya. 

Told Dr Makuloluwa, Apsara and mother. 

I will make sure this opportunity will not go waste. 

I will be the scholar I wanted to be.
