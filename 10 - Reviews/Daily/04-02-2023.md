Thoughts:


In my clinical work there were and there will be patients with stressful outcomes. The most recent on is the [[Negative pressure pulmonary oedema management]] patient who had a large paraphrayngeal abscess. He got negative pressure pulmonary oedme on extubation. I dont think Sharma did anything wrong but the patient developed  frothing and I saw the froth from the ETT and  reminiscence of Anisha and got little worked up.

This was on top of the twice bled Lourdi the tonsillectomy girl. 

I was feeling extremely queasy and decision fatigue on Australia etc made the functioing difficult.

Apsara was busy with Dhanaya at Pasyala but was a huge pillar of strength. 

Kept walking through. Went to Vajiraramaya and worshipped for a very short period but I think that really helped.

Planning to visit Maha Stupa Ruwan Weli Maha Stupa and get bleesing

Another realisation is that there should be a way to continuously decompress than lowg awaited breaks.
