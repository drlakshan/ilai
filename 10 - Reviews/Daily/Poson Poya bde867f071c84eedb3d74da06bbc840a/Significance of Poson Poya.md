It may be said that the Poson Full Moon Poya is one of the most important 
poyas for Sri Lankans. It was on a Poson Poya that Arahant Mahinda Thera
 visited the island and established the Buddha Dhamma during the reign 
of King Devanampiyatissa, which changed the whole history of the island.

After the third Buddhist Council  (Council of Bhikkhus),  Emperor Ashoka of 
India decided to send emissaries to nine countries with the message of 
the Buddha Dhamma. He selected his son Arahant Mahinda Thera to be sent 
to Lanka. Arahant Mahinda however realised that it was not the ideal 
time to visit the island, as King Mutasiva, the Lankan monarch was 
advanced in age and would find it difficult to understand the profound 
Dhamma of the Buddha.

Arahant Mahinda and his entourage visited his mother Devi in the village of Vedisigiri to bide their time until a younger king ascended the throne. After six months King Mutasiva passed 
away and his son Tissa became king.  Arahant Mahinda Thera with four 
bhikkhus –  Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala, Buddhasala, Sumana samanera 
(novice monk), and upasaka Bhanduka -  a layman, arrived at the Missaka 
rock (Mihintale), close to the ancient capital of Anuradhapura on a 
Poson Poya.

It was a festive day in the island and the king was 
on a hunting expedition. Chasing a deer, he had lost his way and arrived
 at the foot of the Missaka rock (Mihintale). Surprised to hear his name
 Tissa being called, he stopped near a mango tree and looked up to see a
 strange group standing on the rock, five in yellow robes.

The Arahant Thera wished to test the king’s intelligence and posed two 
questions in the form of riddles. One was about a mango tree. The king 
answered intelligently and the Arahant knew that he would be able to 
comprehend the Buddha Dhamma. He delivered the Chullahattipadopama Sutta
 to the king and explained that it is about the Buddha, Dhamma and 
Sangha and to live as a disciplined monk and the path to Nibbana which 
is the ultimate goal of a Buddhist. The king and his 40,000 people 
embraced Buddhism, moving away from the earlier worship of trees and 
rocks.

On that day the layman Upasaka Bhanduka was ordained. It 
was the first ordination in the island by the Arahant Thera, as the 
required number of five monks (including himself) were present to 
conduct the ordination. Thereafter Arahant Mahinda lived in Anuradhapura
 for a short time and left to Mihintale where he established the 
Buddha’s teachings in the island. The king cleared many caves in the 
area for the bhikkhus to sit in meditation and achieve their goal.

Mahinda
 Thera who had come to the island at the age of 32 passed away aged 80 
years. The Mihindu Maha Seya in Mihintale is built in his memory and 
people travel there from all parts of the island mainly on Poson Poya to
 venerate the Arahant.

With the arrival of Arahant Mahinda, a 
cultural revolution took place. Buddhist cultural practices prevailed in
 the island. There was development in art, literature, writing and 
sculpture. Carvings on rocks, paintings and writings are seen even today
 making us admire the work of our ancient craftsmen and wonder what 
tools they would have used for those creations.

The large chaityas or dagabas/seyas across the country are works of great skill. 
Made of brick using special materials and the technology of ancient 
times, the dagabas are differently shaped –   we can identify the 
Bubulakara (bubble shape), Dhanyakara (shaped like a heap of paddy), 
Ghantakara (bell shaped),  Ghatakara (pot shaped) and Padmakara (lotus 
shape). There are also two other rare shapes – the Amlakara (shape of a 
Nelli fruit) and Palandawakara (shape of an onion).

At the request of Arahant Mahinda, King Devanampiyatissa requested Emperor 
Ashoka to send the Buddha relics to Lanka. Ashoka sent the right collar 
bone of the Buddha which was enshrined in the Thuparama built by the 
King. This is believed to be the first historic stupa/chaitya built in 
Sri Lanka. Later King Dutugemunu built many dagabas.  In the Ruwanweli 
Maha Seya a drona of the Buddha relics are enshrined, revered by 
Buddhist devotees. Ancient kings built these stupas believing it to be a
 meritorious act.

A stupa/dagaba/chaitya usually has six parts and other structures as protection chambers: Pesavalalu, gharbaya (a hemispherical dome), Hathareskotuwa, Devathakotuwa, Kothkerella and 
Kotha. The Kotha is usually a pinnacle made of metal. A precious crystal
 or gemstone is placed on top of it.

Although the Buddha visited Sri Lanka on three occasions, the Buddha Dhamma was established in the island only after the visit of Arahant Mahinda Maha Thera on a Poson 
poya.

Arahant Mahinda Maha Thera’s visit also paved the way for his sister Arahant Sangamitta Theri to come to Lanka with a sapling of the Sri Maha Bodhi to establish the Meheni Sasana, the order of nuns.
