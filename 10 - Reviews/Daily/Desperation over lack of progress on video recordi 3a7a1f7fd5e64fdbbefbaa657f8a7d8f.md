# Desperation over lack of progress on video recording front

Date: September 16, 2021
Signicant Event: No

Despite many attempts, there is poor progression. Either the lighting is not good, or the background is not clear , powerpoint presenting on both the screens what software to use etc etc never ending problems. 

However with each iteration, there is some improvement of the product. (I hope!) and I need to get on with at finish it off.

On a different front confused over what to do with this latest restrictions of import restrictions. Had a chat with Hasrath and connected to one Chamika who says others have increased the prices but they havent and its likely to have a price increase soon and if you want buy and keep.

Confused.
