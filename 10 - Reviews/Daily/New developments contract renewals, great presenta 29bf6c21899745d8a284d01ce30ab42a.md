# New developments contract renewals, great presentations and readings

Date: August 28, 2022
Signicant Event: No

Couple of things going through my life needs to be documented, 

i initiated discussions about the contract renewal. I believe there should be an increment. I have helped the institution dearly my practice has grown and its a fair assumption that my renumeration needs to grow as well. I asked for a percetange relief without a salary hike. first discussion was with professor. I think I should discuss with Anisa as well. logic is my practice has grown with which the contribution to the hospital. with the percentage system there is a confusion on payments as well. I have passed the 5th year mark and my contract has already lapsed. I dont want a raise in salary just relief of the percentage cuts that will increase my salary without an additional burden for the hospital. Chairman, DC Maiya an most in favourable consideration for my contributions and hopefully they will process it favourably. 

Added to that my presentation on medical tourism went well and according to Rushika lanerolle, that made them salivate and lacrimate!. well it was not intended to be a bait or anything. that presentation was made two months ago. It just happened to be presented on that day. 

Just before the presentation, I had to take the chairman for an ear cleaning. 

One negative thing that I am witnessing is lack of engagement with the Obsidian. Need to correct it immediately.

Reading Da Vinci Code for the second time on paperback. Cant put the book down.
