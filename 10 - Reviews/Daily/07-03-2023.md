Thoughts:

Its sping time. After the long vacation, I came back to work. I felt lifeless yesterday sleepy and all. Decided to attempt again to regain control with food, and perserve with my mobile work life. 

When I dropped suduchooti to school, while walking towards the gate I felt the smell of Ahala Flowers. [[Ahela mal]] denotes a new beginning with [[Erabadu mal]].

In our traditional new year celebrations, we tend to improve our physical existence with the environment. 

Lets hope and strive to achieve same with my life.
