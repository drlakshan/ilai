# Epistaxis patient

Date: January 11, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

While I was in Anuradhapura I got a call. There is an epistaxis patient belonging to CJ has landed to ETU. CJ wanted admission under me. I said no way. I am in Anuradhapura and it is not humanely possible to look after an emergency in such a manner. Ball got passed to apparently Asoka J. Point was they wanted me to manage their patient and none called me even. I said no way but internally i was tormented. Somehow I kept calling the ward to see the status of the patient. To confound the issue I had a family commitment till 10 am so couldnt physically go. I texted AJ too. However I got to know none has at least seen the patient. I went on my way to see the patient. packed the nose and then took to theater and looked after her very well I think.

Outocme

I got Sazli as the second man to attend my ward work.

I have treated a Vice Chancellors's wife who herself is a senior professor

I got Godak Pin Blessing

Yes empathy does pay back

AJ has thanked although kept the phone off
