# Privacy and Home

Date: January 22, 2021
Signicant Event: No

When you come home I like to be in a private environment. I don't like it scattered and dirty. Today when I came home Apsaras sister and her husband and daughter with her brother have come and made a mess. It was a total surprise for me and I don't like such surprises. I like my privacy and loneliness. I made sure that Apsara got it straight.
