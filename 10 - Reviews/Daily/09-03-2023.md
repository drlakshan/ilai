Thoughts:


Invitaiton from Dr Himashi Kularatne to come and see/assist his surgeries is a great thing
Dr Mahanama Gunasekara wanted his parotid surgery done by me
Reputation building tension evoking situation
As I am more into developing myself as a warrior surgeon and with great surgical skills i need to [[take them in stride]]
