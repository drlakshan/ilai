Date: October 8, 2021
Signicant Event: No

this has become the new normal over time. I am ready to face the day unconfused and well prepared. All those things that appeared daunting goes away when you are mentally prepared. Its a very valuable skill. I need to hone it even more. 

I like journeling and this attempt is another step in the process.  It is important to keep on doiing what I am doing.
