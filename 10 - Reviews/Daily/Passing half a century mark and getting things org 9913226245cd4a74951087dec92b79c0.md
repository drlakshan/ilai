# Passing half a century mark and getting things organised

Date: January 31, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

I passed the 50 patients mark and with all the referrals and staff the total was around 60. There is a small caveat. I was absent for two days before. Still it’s an achievement 

I will not get big-headed with this.  But I will improve my patient care further. My moto will always be දුක්ඛප්පත්තාච නිද්දුක්ඛා ........

I was also glad to see dr Chandima de Mel referring patients back again after NG fiasco.
