# Metta of Buddha

Date: March 17, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Just realised an important aspect of Buddha’s Metta. He sacrificed His ability to attain Nibbana for himself for the betterment of the mankind. He suffered for us. As a lay desciple I need to do a similar sacrifice and bear this performance anxiety and mental agony for my patients. I did the submandibular gland excision nicely without damaging any nerves and Akram’s assistance was really great and helpful 

What I realise is that I too get a great sense of satisfaction when the surgery goes well and the patient is cured because of my involvement. So I shouldn’t stop operating. I should weather the stress of surgery show off or fake it till you make it sort of attitude and endure the pain for my patients. They come in search of it. They are not reluctant to pay they just want the quality service the I and only few can really offer. As a result I think I need to develop a skill set that will be useful to develop my mind so that I can endure such stressors of the Surgeon’s life quite comfortably.
