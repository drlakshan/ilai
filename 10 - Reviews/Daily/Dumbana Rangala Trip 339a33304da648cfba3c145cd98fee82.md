# Dumbana Rangala Trip

Date: January 28, 2021
Signicant Event: No

Came to a lovely place in Central Hills. Beautiful scenery. Lovely weather - Good Company. Different experience. Most Importantly was able to meditate despite all the worldly matters and leeches. 

At the same time realised how impermant these worldly pleasures are and although we were actively discussing future plans, am not so sure how things will workout.

Discussions about wealth management also took place - Gold came up best
