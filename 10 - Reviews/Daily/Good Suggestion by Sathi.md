Good suggestion for donations/dhana : Sacrifice money from a meal and donate that money

This is related to the act of gratitude after worshipping set aside some money as a collection for donation. i need to reignite this. It may be best to do digitally. As when tried to do that before, there was no place to collect. may be I can use the digital wallet. may be i can designate an account for this and use this to collect money for this purpose.
use [[Anatomy of a Tiny Habit According to BJ Fogg]]

After : I worship in the morning
Behaviour : I will donate some money to my merit account
Celebrate : transferring of blessing/merits to All the deities that accompany me on my endeavours.
