# Supercharged

Date: January 14, 2022
Signicant Event: No

Getting supercharged due to continual practice of meditation, yoga and physical exercises. Small volume but consistent. Recent listening to the podcast about the visual systems involvement in physical well being has also helped. Physiological sigh and peripheral vision. 

Educationally with the help of Obsidian and Anki and Zotero I am supercharging my professional development and with the help of thinking with others optimising the financial work flow too.
