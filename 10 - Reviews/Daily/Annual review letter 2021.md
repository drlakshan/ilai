# Annual review letter

Date: December 25, 2020
Significant Event: Yes

Here it goes. There’s no point in postponing it any further. I will take this moment to write the annual review letter for 2021. (in 2020!) 

When I look back on the year 2021 following are the achievements :

1: **Realisation** now I can see the world as is. This is the greatest achievement. Not only in 
2021 but for the entire Samsaric Existence. I used google phone that I bought long while back loaded it with the book and sermons. I could adjust the speed of play back in that which I couldn't do in the Iphone and I slowly but surely went forward. Read Niwana and Paticha Sampuppada Books and listened to the Dhamma.

2: **Notion** became my go-to solution for almost every thing. I learnt about Databases and applied that knowledge to all aspects of my life. It grew so rapidly I am happy they removed the limitations on the storage!

3. My **net worth** has doubled over the year

4. I created a successful online presence and way to deliver my services to the needy to relieve suffering with compassion, care and empathy I also have an online course on ENT subjects
