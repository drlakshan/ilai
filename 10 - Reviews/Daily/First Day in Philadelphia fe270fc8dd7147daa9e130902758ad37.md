# First Day in Philadelphia

Date: September 10, 2022
Signicant Event: Yes

Came to America

Although long and tiresome, was able to finish to book Ikigai way

eager to put some of the leaning in to practice. 

one of the hiccups was that I didnt have battery left in the phone. next time best to keep the phone off as I am not going to use it in the plane anyway. and have a battery pack (a small one - check the allowed powers before flying) 

plan out the airport transfers as this a real money waster

with the batteries off there was no way to get the access codes. I had two phones but the other one didnt have a sim. sim ejection tool. something that need to be with you all the time.

the other major miss was the travel adapter for america. either full one or whatever works need to be with me. 

Anyhow managed to sort out all of that. 

eager to learn physically and mentally prepared. 

this is going to be another revolution. I would like to call it. “Operation Ikigai”
