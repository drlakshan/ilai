# A productive day

Date: August 25, 2022
Signicant Event: No

I thought I must write about this particular day because I was able to achieve quite a lot on that day. 

I went to get my car cleaned while waiting for it to happen I went to a coffee shop and go out my laptop and started working. I will see able to book my accommodation in the New York city I visible to send the receipt for rent, decided on the army hospital involvement using mind  mapping. 

Got the accommodation details on to tripit. Spoke to finance company and jewellers and was able to do surgery and look after patients that's quite a lot I was so focused and with that I was able to achieve this.
