# 4 AM meditation

Date: May 7, 2021
Signicant Event: No

Got up without any alarm at 4 AM. I meditated very well. Stretching exercises and new found habit of looking at those patients who are going to be better because of my interventions, and now journalling. 

I am glad the way my mental development is taking place. When the Macbook hard drive was erased and couldn't be restored, I kept on trying with Googling the error messages and was able to restore it fully. 

Fine tuning is happening. No more unsuitable apps here!
