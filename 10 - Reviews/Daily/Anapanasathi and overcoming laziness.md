# Anapanasathi and overcoming laziness

Date: January 14, 2021
Signicant Event: No

When i feel low probably secondary to Dopamine nadir, trying anapanasathi meditation helped me to finish quite a lot of research work today. I think  Prathama Dyana is helping me a lot. I will strive to improve the tranquility.
