Signicant Event: Yes

Today I plan to inaugurate my Nawaloka HQ. I got a list of things that are needed and got them from Keels and planning to organise it today. 

As a summary, I got the room re done, I got the office redone with name board, I got the theater re allocated OT -3, and I also got the ward 10 awaiting the name board. Workforce wise I got the Nawaloka OT whatsapp group organised.
