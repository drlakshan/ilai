# Back to the Office

Date: July 14, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Until I was working practically everywhere as I gave my reading area to Minudi. yesterday there was a shift in the place of work. Apsara helped me to create a little niche in the second room. I set up the external monitor table and the key board and I am now comfortable there to work. one of the first tasks that I took on board was to read about the submissions for the OTO journal. A plus point is that since I am from a list B country, I am eligible for a processing fee waiver. So must start writing. There is practically no reason that I shouldn't.
