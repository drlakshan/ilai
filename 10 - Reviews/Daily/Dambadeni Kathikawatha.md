# Dambadeni Kathikawatha

Date: March 7, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Today I plan to visit Wijayasundaramaya and Rajadhani Estate. In the temple after worshipping the Noble Triple Gem, I would like to meditate and revive my education.
When it comes to education, I have been consistently improving it. But there are areas I really need to work on. e,g American Academy lectures, CME program researches ANKI etc.
Mental development is the other area I'd like to improve.

Areas needing resolutions

1. Meditation and vipassana 
2. Nutrition 
3. Excercise
4. American Academy work
