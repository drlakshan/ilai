Signicant Event: No

There is a new concept or attitude that is getting developed. During the patient's course of care via me, most troublesome part is after discharge. out of sight is not out of mind for me. !

How do patients contact me?

1. email
2. phone calls
3. WhatsApp
4. via Tharuka
5. via Miyurangi
6. coming straight to OPD
7. Calling the ward

I should be comfortable and they should be comfortable and also there should be no catastrophe

Post op instructions on communication

1. contact numbers ETU, Miyurangi, Tharuka/Theater cordinator /Ward
    1. Miyurangi —> get them to hotline whatsapp —> ward —> ETU physically or any local hospital
    2. This is the pathway for emergency contact
    3. Routine care Whatsapp hotline messages only
    
2. Messaging via whatsapp message only option on whatsapp business

So when any post operative complaints happens without an ego I need to attend and make sure my patient is safe. EMPATHY! remember TRC
