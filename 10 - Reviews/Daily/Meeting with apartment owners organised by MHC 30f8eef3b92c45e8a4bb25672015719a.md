# Meeting with apartment owners organised by MHC

Date: March 18, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

There was a meeting organised by Arjun from the Millenium Property Developers and some of the owners attended. It was fruitful in two ways. 

1. Could meet up people who live here and was able to brush up few sore spots
2. Got some solid reassurances from the builders that things are not so gloomy after all.
