Signicant Event: No

What a day it was! Started work at 6 AM with a Total Thyroidectomy on a young boy for a thyroid carcinoma and with a great outcome. Grommet surgery, seeing patients with kindness getting Dr Ruberu's patients and Lovely chat with Akram about future of our practice. Gifts received from a drug company an auroscope, something else from Riaz, bought gold from Prashanth, got NDB docs sent off, had a lovely time at Car meditated listened to Dhamma, met Vogue Jewellers daughter and arranged for Jewellery purchases and yet to come need to get angels from Kadawatha. That's a lot isn't it? 

Ps it didn’t end. Contacted Iroshan of AutoMiraj and organised a car detailing
