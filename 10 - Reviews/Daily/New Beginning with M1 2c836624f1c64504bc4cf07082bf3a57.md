# New Beginning with M1

Date: May 6, 2021
Signicant Event: No

problem with browser hijacking issue most probably introduced with Adobe cracked software. I didn't like the idea from the beginning. Did try to completely wipeout the hard disk and start all over. So many error messages popped up but managed to salvage and restore without a glitch. New beginning all the best!
