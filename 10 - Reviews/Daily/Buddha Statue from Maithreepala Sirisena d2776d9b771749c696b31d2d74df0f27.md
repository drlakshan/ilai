# Buddha Statue from Maithreepala Sirisena

Date: March 30, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

I received a beautiful mind concentrating and Buddhalambana Pretthiya upadawana buddha statue from MS as a gift for the surgery I did on him. Its great that this coincided with the events happening right now in my life. Ovindi has become a "big girl". I have just completed a major surgery Revision Thyroidectomy with Sternotomy without any complications. There is a transition away from worldly pleasures. 

Had the oppportunity to listen to the Athkanda Upamawa again. Something to ponder every now and then.
