# DayOne Journaling

Date: December 16, 2020
Signicant Event: No

I am back with the journaling. Whilst going through the previous apps that I’ve installed, I found DAYONE app in my purchased app list and I thought I would give it another try. I found that because I had a classic version of the software it didn’t work as intended. So I reverted back to notion which seems to be working pretty fine and I must stick to the resolution that I will not keep on adding software so at the end of the day not doing anything productive. In addition to that I am using voice typing more frequently than physical typing these days and I find that very fast and effective.
