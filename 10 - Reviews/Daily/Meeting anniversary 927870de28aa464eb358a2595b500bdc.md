# Meeting anniversary

Date: May 17, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

It had been 21 years after Apsara came in to my life. I explained to her that, it is this day that is more important than the weeding anniversary as this is the day she came in to my life. We both are extremely contended and as i told her, we are treddding this path without losing touch of "Dhamma Margaya". That is the key thing.
