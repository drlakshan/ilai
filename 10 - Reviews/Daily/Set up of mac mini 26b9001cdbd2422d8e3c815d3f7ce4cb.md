Date: July 17, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Since I got the logitech keyboard and the mouse now  I am using the new Mac Mini. I am super thrilled about the workspace improvements that I have achieved with the technology. But the key outcome measure will be what I am going to achieve with this.

Keep centralised repository of files. 

Access them using 

macbook air

iphone

macmini

and web enabled devices

options icloud
