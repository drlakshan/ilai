# Got up at 4:30 automatic

Date: February 23, 2021
Signicant Event: No

Got up at 4:30 meditated, cleared my mind with a mind dump attended to couple of things and exercised. Slowly and surely Kizen.

Developing nawaloka head quarters as well. I am sure I can develop it fully.

Got to know that Ward 10 name board was blocked by Harshith. He didn't like to put my name on the ward. Thats fine. I didn't ask for it myself. It was Dr Maiya who asked. The problem is why?
