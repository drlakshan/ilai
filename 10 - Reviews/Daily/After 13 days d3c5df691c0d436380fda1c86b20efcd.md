# After 13 days

Date: June 21, 2021
Signicant Event: No

Got busy and mentally stronger. Tracheostomy event where I held my ground, learning about bilateral cord palsy in ICU setting are just a few things. 

Started learining about new software like obs and davinci resolve

Took an inventory of things happening in my life so that I could do some filtering.
