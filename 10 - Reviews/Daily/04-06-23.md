## Direction:


Wanted to try Drupal again and finding it tough may be its a good idea to let it go. But a part of me doesn't want to do that.
What is the best for my patients would be a good starting point. What is not important is what is the tool I am going to use to achieve this. What is more important is what is it I need to do to deliver a world class service for my patients. I feel if i create a user profile for my patients where they can access their prescriptions, surgery details, including pictures and symptoms scores and patient education leaflets and information. That way they will have the access to their previous prescription and stuff. is it a good thing? I don't know, I think best to send selected items rather than giving point blank access to everything clinical. that may be used against me too. so need to be careful. What I can do is to create a content type called patient and upon registration to get the basic demographics and then when prescriptions are added in a template format print and email whenever they come. i am excited. should not give this up too.
