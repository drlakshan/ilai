# Connected thinking

Date: April 23, 2022
Signicant Event: Yes

I have been trying my level best to create a connected setup for Obsidian app

I almost tried other  notetaking apps but soon realised NOWAY I am going to deviate from the great note taking app called Obsidian

The connectedness and the power of back links helps my thought process cleaness futureproofing markup language speed distraction freeness etc are very helpful features

Still not ready to pay close to 30K for syncing (official version) a year!

This is the setup

I have the main vault setup on the Macmini Desktop. This is synced with the F42 and the S6 tab

Edit: created F42 as the main setup

Syncing happens with Syncthing - an opensource software

No intermediary services like google drive dropbox any of those.

Test run was good yesterday. 

Lets see how things go.
