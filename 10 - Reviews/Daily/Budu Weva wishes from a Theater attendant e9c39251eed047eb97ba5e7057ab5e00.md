# Budu Weva wishes from a Theater attendant

Date: January 26, 2021
Signicant Event: No

There was this patient - a staff member of the operation theatre who got a sore throat. He didn't get better with Sharma's meds and was complaining of some pus discharge. It was a quinsy. I gave him the usual options of admission IV drainage etc however it was quite obvious that he couldn't afford any of that here at Nawaloka. He didn't fancy going to the state sector either. 

I did a make-shift scalpel anaesthetised the throat and drained pus and blood. He became immediately better and was very grateful to me. He wished me SIr Budu wenawa Sir he said. that is one of the best wishes one can get. I got it. 

Walking along the pathway resurfaced by Lord Buddha I am shining like the moon coming out of dark clouds.
