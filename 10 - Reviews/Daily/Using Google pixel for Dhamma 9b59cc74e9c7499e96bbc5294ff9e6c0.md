# Using Google pixel for Dhamma

Date: December 26, 2020
Signicant Event: Yes

---

I have a Google phone. I also have a problem to solve. Which is this. When trying to follow Dhamma by කටුකුරුන්දේ ඤානානන්ද හිමි sinhala typing is necessary and voice typing is the easiest. However iphone doesn't support it. Google pixel ace it. But the pixel has miniscule battery life being a very old phone. Sorted the problem by buying a power bank and keeping it plugged all the while. I fully charged the battery now on the 26th. And let's see how long will it last. !

Second thing I am going do is to download sermons right in to this phone and try to learn simultaneously

All the best to me!
