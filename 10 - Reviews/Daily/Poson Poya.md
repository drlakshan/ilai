# Poson Poya

Date: June 14, 2022
Signicant Event: Yes

This poya day I need to make a action plan, a way of life, something I can check whether I had adhered to. 

**Education**

I will adhere to Obsidian and keep on expanding my knowledge 

troubleshooting and learning more on the subject including dataview plugin

but don’t try to get everything in to it.

Keep obsidian for education

**Project planning with Trello**

Use Zotero to collect data and Anki to remember

Perseverance

Perseverance is the persistence after fully tired of doing the difficult tasks and start all over again

important projects

this is going to be distilled buddhist way portraying through my deeds words and thoughts

armed with what I do have and what I will acquire, I will slowly develop

another assessment of the situation will be done at the end of this month on the Esala Poya day.

last update 10:20 pm

Today is the Poson poya day.  a long time back , on a day like today, Arahant Mihindu Himi and the team came to Sri Lanka.  Sri Lankans got the message of the Lord Buddha. I dont know whether I was a Sri Lankan then too or not. But the point is as present day Sri Lankan, it has a significance to me. 

At the same time, skills and crafts were supposedly introduced to Sri Lankans by a team of experts accompanying Arhant Mahinda Maha Rahathan Wahanse.

[Significance of Poson Poya](Significance%20of%20Poson%20Poya.md)

In my life also I intend to create (or recreate or enhance) a buddhist cultural revolution.

I have found a meaning of work or retirement - to be of service to others. Money will be a by product. (keep this to yourself i e don’t brag)

Way of work

I have gone back to Trello for planning todos

Will stick with awesome Obsidian 

Meddled with Zotero trying to send file to tablet worked a bit then becuse of two pathways for storage and tablet file destination (may be) there was an issue. Didnt want to spend too much time on this as I am unlikely read on the tablet to annotate and Mega is offering 30GB free storage for me. That is good enough

Zotero storage will be used for cataloguing everything including youtube videos. can make notes on those and include Sinhala fonts as well. searchable.

Anki is for spaced repetition.

Obsidian for note making.
