# New year new beginning

Date: April 14, 2021
Signicant Event: No

Came to Pasyala. Got stuck with usual kids don't want to leave situation. However I had time for myself. I used the time to learn about Inkscape. Immediately fell in love with it. There are quite a few potential uses of it. 

a. I can use it to get bitmap images and trace to vector ones so that I can scale them very large without losing clarity / no pixalation

b. I can remove back grounds after using the path tool and clipping the images together. 

c. I can use it to draw basic structures and text effects. 

d. Above can all be used for my presentations without copyright issues and very high quality audios.

SO introduction to Inkscape was a great plus.

Additionally I kept staring at the pouring rain. Another one of my favourite things. 

I was emotionally in charge too. I didn't let my temper loosen. I kept calm meditated. Wow what a transformation Dr Lakshan!
