Thoughts:

tech revolution of the practice is happening and being appreciated too. Want to pursue this to the finish. ultimate target Health.lk google workspace based comprehensive quality practice to my patients. and that will give satisfaction to me too. 

Treated Esufally family (Heama's owners) nd Prof Ariyaratne yesterday. So my reputation is building. Lets enhance with value addition.

Tax issue. its rather contentious and I feel its best to be lawful and be ok with it. Other's are charging the same amount as I so may be a slight increase because I add value by computer generated stuff is ok. Lets hold on to it for the next six months then in 2024 we can think of it.
