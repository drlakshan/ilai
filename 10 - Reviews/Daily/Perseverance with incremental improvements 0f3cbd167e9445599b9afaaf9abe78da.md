I am a keen believer in marginal gains where incremental increases in processes and other things in life gradually and slowly will make things better in the future. This concept is fabled by the British cycling - Team Sky coach Sir Dave Brailsford who did small improvements in multiple things that improved team's performances. Something we can incorporate in our lives too.
