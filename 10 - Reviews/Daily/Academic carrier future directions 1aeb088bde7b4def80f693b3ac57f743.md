# Academic carrier future directions

Date: February 23, 2022
Signicant Event: No

With newer opportunities arising pathways can be difficult to choose. Permanent post in Anatomy for instance has come up. It would be viable option to take on that but current job satisfaction and income generation has created a dilemma. I do not want to give up what I do now. As I am very happy with current situation and hence I will continue to contribute as a volunteer and be happy about it. Its a volunteer job that I do with many other commitments. 

What mr Backhouse asked me comes to my mind.

What will you get by doing this? I said nothing except satisfaction satisfaction of teaching. 

By product will be lot of academic work out put. 

I will not be a professor. It was never the plan. Plan was to be a teacher and an academic. I will do that and review the situation in three months.
