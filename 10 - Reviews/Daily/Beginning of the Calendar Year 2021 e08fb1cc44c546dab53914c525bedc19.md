# Beginning of the Calendar Year 2021

Date: January 2, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

In samsaric existence dawn of a "new year" is a concept that will only give some false sense of hope. Nonetheless it's a "hope". So there is nothing wrong with it. Except that it is an illusion. this year after all those thoughts and experiments in the past, I have taken a different approach. I have created a mindset of continuous improvement. Over the years, I have tried many methods, used many tools, done so many experiments with my own life. I have this concept of "life should be a continuous controlled experiment". But the problem of this approach is that you are eternally experimenting rather than been "useful" or "productive". This time I have created a freeze on the tools both physical and software wise to achieve this so called improvement. I don't think that there is a universal definition of this "improvement". To me, moving towards calmness, flow, resilience, leading a life of piety are the features I would like my life to have. So without jumping from one platform to the other, I need to start building or outputting using the chosen tools - tested for many many years. So at least until the end of 12 months - again used as a reference point- there would not be a major change in the "tools", I will continually tinker habits so that truly mobile learner concept is adhered to.
