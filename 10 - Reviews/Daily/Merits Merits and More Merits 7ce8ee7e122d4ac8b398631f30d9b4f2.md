The lady who came from Hamabantota who called her present day "Patachara" who was relieved by my caring

The old lady who was very happy after DCR surgery and so many people who said that they came to seek solace with me 

All these make me feel blessed

Why did I make it milestone? because I will try to remember by greater purpose of life and try to live up to it.
