# They want to be back

Date: March 2, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Yasath spoke to me. Website is down etc and he wants me back in the council and apparently Sanjeewani is resigning. He is saying there was a miscommunication thats why I was not included to the council last time and he wants be back again. I consented and must make sure that I don't get a post as such. I will work as an ordinary council member. Quickly recovered the website as well. 

In coconut development front got lots of contact and organised CDO to visit the state.
