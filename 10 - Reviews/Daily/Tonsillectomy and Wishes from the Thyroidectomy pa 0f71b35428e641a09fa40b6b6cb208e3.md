Did a wonderful tonsillectomy. Felt really good about it. Moreover last weeks Thyroidectomy patient came for review was so grateful and said she reminds me in veneration on the early morning Buddha worshipping and thank me for doing such a wonderful job and did not feel any pain not even an ant's bite!
