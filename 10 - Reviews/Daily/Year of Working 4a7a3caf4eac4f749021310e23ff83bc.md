# Year of Working

Date: December 9, 2020
Signicant Event: No

this year is going to be hard work and smart work. 

Year 46 is starting today.

Mentally and physically I want to counter "laziness"  This poor quality leads to tardiness as well. Spiritually and worldly I can not progress because of this. Lets work really hard and counter that.

How the year review in 2021 would read:

<aside>
💡 This year has been particularly productive. I got 10 research publications. Finished JavaScript course and built my app. Used Notion as a second brain and developed it to the present state. CME work flow was developed. I also instituted a hardware and software "lock" no changes for year for software and three years for hardware.

started the celebrations by giving every one a new habit.

Gave the access to emails - she cried!
