# Sathi nimiththa Wadi diyunu kireema

Date: May 28, 2021
Signicant Event: No

Vesak poya two days were a great stepping stone in my spiritual development

Observed sil for 6hours

Meditated

listened to three full dhamma deshanas

Improved sathi nimiththa

fact that sathi nimiththa has to be strengthened and do all the work with the sathiminiththta focused was taken strongly.

For the next upcoming days I will be developing sathi nimiththa and do the activities with sathi nimithta in hand
