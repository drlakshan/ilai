# Anuradhapura Pilgrimage and Meditation

Date: January 10, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Today I decided to visit Maha Stupa and get my meditation back on track. It was wonderful. On the way I listened to couple of sermons by Ven Katukurunde Gnanananda Thero and meditation instructions by a gihi yogi. I took advice with great contemplation. 

16 steps of Anapanasathi. This is what I am learning these days. Sathi nimiththa and how the in-breath and out-breath is carried out with great awareness. How the Prathamadyana - vithakka vichara preethi sukha ekaggatha can be achieved with the first set of 4 kayaanupassana.

This is the way forward

Also I will also make a note of three things that happened during Anuradhapura visit.

1. with greatest ease I meditated and entered the deep levels of Samadhi at Ruwan Mali maha stupa
2. How the live chanting was about 16 steps of anapaanasathi via Girimananda Sutta
3. How I had to meditate at Sri Maha Bhodi due to a light shower

Well bonus point would be despite driving for so long all the time trying to get the Sathi Nimittha, was not tiring at all. It confirmed how sandittika Dhamma is.
