# Apsara’s Father passed away

Date: February 7, 2022
Signicant Event: Yes

Funeral was held. He passed away on the 5th February 2022. Simple transition from one state to another. Paving way for Loku malli to be happy with his son and nangi to go abroad without remorse. 

Drove Jeepee for a long stretch and having that in my life helped.
