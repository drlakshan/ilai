# First cocconut crop plucked

Date: April 5, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Yesterday we did our first coconut plucking. 835 nuts harvested and sold at 56 each. This is despite the plantation is not tendered with fertiliser and without proper taking care of.

Additionally we marked where the house is going to be built. Need to study house design and take it forward.
