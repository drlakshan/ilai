# Beautiful Incident at Vajiraramaya

Date: January 13, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

It's Apsara's Birthday. Wanted to go to a temple. Vajiraramaya is the obvious choice on any day. But it was late. Way too late. And it is closed to the public due to COVID. Anyway decided to go there and pay homage from outside.
When reaching the place, there was a foreign monk at the gate. He looked very different and exuding enormous grace. He started walking towards us. We were curious and got out of the car and paid respect. He said he thought we were someone else he was expecting - that person also was supposed to come in a white car. He asked what brings us there. I said we came to worship knowing that the temple is closed, we will worship from outside and go. He said that no need to do that. He invited us into the temple. Gates were open for our car. Lights were switched on for us. Had peaceful worship and offerings at the end. We were overjoyed. At the same time surprised by how we got so lucky.
It can certainly be considered an omen. A good one to start the year 2021!
