# Not selected for the council - again

Date: March 29, 2022
Signicant Event: Yes

Not selected for the next council

He asked whether Id like to take the scientific secretatry post which I declined and said will work at the capacity of the committee member. Aparenetly he didnt like it. Anyway I have decided softly that I will not work with him - it isnt going to be happy 

I will dedicate next two years for the next phase of my OWN studying, 

just the way i did over the last two years:

research network

senior lecturer post in medical education

Zotero library development

clinical key

this two years 

improvements in work flows

AAO HNS

make sure that you become so good that they cant ignore you

Deep work concept
