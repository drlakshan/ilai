# Monthly and weekly goals are back

Date: July 5, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

With the progression of journalling and organising my life and giving it a purpose, I have re discovered monthly and weekly goals. I will keep them DUMB (DUMB vs SMART) because I don't want my life to be stressed up.

They will serve as a purpose and direction towards how the professional time should flow.
