# Anuradhapura Pilgrimage

Date: April 6, 2022
Signicant Event: Yes

Planning to visit Ruwan Mali Maha Stupa and Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi

Want to deeply engrain the commitment to enlightenment 

at a superficial level continuous education

1. Meditation and buddhist attitudes
2. education revival
3. blessings for Sudu Duwa and Chooti
4. find a “talisman”
5. blessings for the new apartment
6. economic stability and decision support

addendum 1 : whilst travelling to worship the Maha Bodhi and Maha Stupa was able to listen to a sermon by Kiribathgoda Gnananda Thero . It was about getting the refuge from Thisaranaya

**thisaranaya pihita laba ganeema**

got to know that sudu duwa was selected to continue studies in the English medium. serendipitous valedictorian !

addendum 2

08 April 2022

with the power I regenerated at the Maha Bodhi and Maha Stupa I work in a different energy level and with a different outlook towards life

Worldlly problems do not seem to perturb me. I am trying to work through them with mental power that I have harnessed through ages of mental practice.

eg. Trachestomy patient issue

cheque issue ; where I have issued a cheque from a wrong cheque book

broken screen issue

my patient’s issues
