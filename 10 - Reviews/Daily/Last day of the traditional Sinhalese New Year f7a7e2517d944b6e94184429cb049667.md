# Last day of the traditional Sinhalese New Year

Date: April 13, 2021
Signicant Event: No

I do like doing auspicious times for the sake of culture. And I do like the concepts embedded in those. Like stopping work, reflecting with the help of Dhamma and starting afresh. And the reverence given stops at that. I don't take them very seriously. I am a Buddhist. I have a clear pathway of doing things. I just need to follow that. 

One important thing to ponder about is why the academic work is not progressing as they should. 

Other important areas needing attention.

a. Video production: I got all the needed stuff but no production! ?

b. New found graphic interest and practice of it.
