Thoughts:

Need to incorporate Pixel to my life style. I will slowly do that. No hurry at all. I like both the manual and voice typing experiences. May be more manual typing than voice. I like the fact that there is a small gap of time for brain to process and come up with better words in proper articulation. May be I should speak slow. That might increase the quality of my typing.
