# Chat with Sharma

Date: May 9, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Had a heart to heart chat with Sandeep at Barista cafe.

It is heartening to see how things have evolved for him over the time. He got emotional telling about the worst night ever in his life where they had to sleep on floor with newspapers as bed linen. I congratulated him for rising from that level to where he is now. very inspiring. i briefly mentioned that i had a similar past.

When is the lowest point in my life economically?

is it when i was scolded for coming early to collect monthly "stipend" at Fort fruit stall

or is it when mother and brother started walking away since i couldn't relieve their debts 

or is it when i thought of committing suicide jumping on to a car so that they can get compensation and be off debt

somehow with the help of Apsara I was able to save my family from debt and took it to where it is now.
