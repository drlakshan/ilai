# Am I the most sought after?

Date: November 19, 2022
Signicant Event: Yes

Today I did a comparison to see whether my limiting of practice is helping or not. I think the limiting of the practice helps as I may be the most prebooked consultant at the moment.

Nothing to be arrogant about but to dwell on things that went right, what went wrong and what more can be done in a consistent small volume fashion so that I may be of use to my fellow beings.

to provide excellent care in treatment in ENT disorders to fellow beings with highest standards was and still is, my professional mission.
