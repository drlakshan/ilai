# Annual Letter for 2022

Date: December 30, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

This is it. End of 2021. Need to write THE letter. 

Additionally I must mention I have created an ambience of snowy mountain with AC and the Sony Headset. (which I bought as a gift for my self on 22 December 2021

I have also realised that the year end is not a particular day but a period where we can use to contemplate. It is not a particular point in time but a a time period.  May be starting from 9th December to 13 January ( Lakshan’s Birthday to Apasara’s Birthday).

Here is the letter:

Year 2022 has been a great year for me and our family. Although the country’s economic and social situation is not the most fantastic of all, individually at our level  we have achieved something. Something great!

Meditation wise I have become achieved a great level. important thing is I have used electronics and IT to help achieve my mental training. I have adhered to my morning routine of Anapanasathi Bhawanawa first thing in the morning and the time spent has increased so is the quality of tranquility. To see the world as is this samadhi helps. With this bojjanga dhamma has developed. It was a good decision not to leave as I have got the necessary environment for spiritual development here.

Physically I have got the physique and the biochemistry right. I got the weight <60kg, BP normal, HBA1C 6 Lipid profile and OT/PT normal

Professionally, my academic carrier has improved quite dramatically! i use Zotero-obsidien-anki as the digital tools trio and my knowledge graph is phenomenal. I have published 10 articles this year. Attended AAO meeting in Philadelphia which renewed the knowledge again.

I am the most admired teacher in the Faculty and I get the help of the academic background and the facilities to develop my self. 

Nawaloka practice has doubled. I see average 50 patients a day perform 25 major surgeries a month and earn close to 4M a month. I decided to stay at Nawaloka without freelancing - which is rather obvious - as thats the whole point in joining private sector in my case - to be in a place where I can deliver a great service without running around the country side.

I have a pretty stable team, anaesthetic, channeling assistant, theater coordinator, theater team ( Nisansala, Jayarathana, Kothale, Subha, Boy whose name i keep on forgetting), marketing team

Financially I have collected wealth in the form of gold and land. 

I have been helpful to my family and others and despite less than desired gratitude, I was able to deliver my “services” / obligations to them with equanimity.
