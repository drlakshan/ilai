---# Website, Again

Date: September 13, 2022
Signicant Event: Yes

One of the important take home messages that I learnt during the sessions was how important is to have a web presence. 

imortance of google reviews came up again and again. 

they do thumbs up and down and then for those who are giving thumbs up get a link to review you. 

I think for me also this website thingy has to fly.

I see so many lags with my current WP setup and As google is the one how is doing site ranking thought of giving “google sites” a try. 

I did the basic frame work and got the verification done. next would be to unlink the site and get the new google site in. One of the achivements of this trip would be that if I can get that pulled out.
