# Just shouldn't stop journalling

Date: June 7, 2021
Signicant Event: No

There is a tendency to stop things I have started half way through. 

That is not the Buddhist way of doing things. Arabatha, Nikkamatha, Yunjatha Buddha Sasana

So I  too need to enter in to the never stepping mode. I am kind of been hard on me. i am a usually non-stopper. ;-)
