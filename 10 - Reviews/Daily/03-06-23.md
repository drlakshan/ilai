The Buddhist Revolution


Thoughts:

Observed sil and started a dhamma revolution today
meditated and listened to dhamma deshana by Mankadawala sudassana himi on udaya weya baleema
ways to proceed further

1. Trekmentor site and searching for the bikku and take it forward from there
2. Reading and listening to Katukurunde Himi



The Key question

- Form (rūpa)
- Feeling (vedanā)
- Perception (saññā)
- Mental Formations (saṅkhārā)
- Consciousness (viññāṇa) 

consciousness is the master key.
