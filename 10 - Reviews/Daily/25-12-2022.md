## Direction:


I am learning and trying to improve upon my systems here. looking at the past thinking about the present getting ready for the future.


## What need to be achieved today:


Thinking about life

Thoughts:

Nuwara Eliya break 
at the end of 2022
what a life it is
that unfolds before us

LIfe can be a challange
As it should be
tredding with care and deligence
we need to workout things

birth to the death
life needs to flow 
gracefully and peacefully
guided by experiences
