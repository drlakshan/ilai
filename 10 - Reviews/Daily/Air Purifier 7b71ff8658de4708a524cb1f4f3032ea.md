I thought I will give a try. It looked promising. The problem I have in this room is sometimes I get congested and nagging heaviness in the head. I think this is at least partly, due to the dust particles in the room. I read couple of reviews and all were positive about the benefits of air purifiers. So I bought one. LKR 17K from Singer Lets see whether it works!
