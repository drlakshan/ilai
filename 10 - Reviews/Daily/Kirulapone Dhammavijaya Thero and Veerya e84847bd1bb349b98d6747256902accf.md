# Kirulapone Dhammavijaya Thero and Veerya

Date: June 25, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Weerya is the key element that I need to work on. Although the pathway is clear and what to do is defined, there is a lethargy in the progression alone the pathway.

Ven Kirulapone Dhammavijaya thero presented him to me with a ear perforation and I could attend to him with compassion and care. After researching more on thero and the milestones he has achieved, it was clear that Weeriya is the most important faculty that I need to inculcate. Lack of which is the most important deterrrent in my pathway to progression.

I have started a yet another progression towards the goals.
