# Simplification

Date: January 17, 2021
Signicant Event: No

Things that we can do in this world in a DAY is limited. Things that could be done is unlimited. We can get a rough idea as to what is worth doing and what isn’t. But the important life decision is what will our time be spent on. 

In our journey from cradle to coffin there is only a limited time. Unknown to us yet certainly limited. How do we fill it is the key. Key to what ? you ask. Key to happiness or lack of it,  key to wealth or lack of it, key to health or lack of it. There is no limit to qualities I can put there. 

So how can we go about this business of life then? Find a mission, find a meaning, find some broad objectives. At least have some direction which might help you to walk towards those. And then fill the DAY with the appropriate behaviours. Really that’s all you can do.
