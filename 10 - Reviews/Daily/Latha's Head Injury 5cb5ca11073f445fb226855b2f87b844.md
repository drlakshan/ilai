# Latha's Head Injury

Date: March 23, 2021
Signicant Event: No

Got a call from SuduDuwa saying that Latha Nanda had hit her head somewhere and now bleeding heavily. I said nothing to worry apply pressure and I will be there. Instead of going by my car, I realised I could get an ambulance and go with it. That will make it much faster and it certainly did. And also I will have medical supplies with me. When I went there bleeding has stopped. I just put some dressings and came.
