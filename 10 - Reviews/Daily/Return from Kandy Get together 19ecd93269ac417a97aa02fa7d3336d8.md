# Return from Kandy Get together

Date: August 1, 2022
Signicant Event: Yes

July was hectic. Mother’s health concerns were troubling me. My sugars and cholesterol. Ovindi. Country is not doing well, migration concerns. However the current thinking is that I need to stay and battle it out bringing the best of myself in the process. 

Invited to Kandy to attend the musical night organised by Naram. 

initial hesitation post vaccination etc but went (in a van with issues. )

had a nice time with friends good food at Kiridena’s 

thought a lot about the processes and life.

decided to lead a SIMPLE LIFE and persistently better it.
