# Daughters’ Medical assessments

Date: February 24, 2022
Signicant Event: Yes

Both Ovindi and Minudi got their scans

Both were normal except for 1mm or 2mm sized nodules in Ovindi and faecal overload in Minudi

Both are good news.

Next steps would be to thank doctors and carry on no further worries

Learning point would be how I didn’t avoid Ovindi’s investigations. She was annoyed - super annoyed but I did it. It was thought that I will face the problems and sort it out rather than avoiding.
