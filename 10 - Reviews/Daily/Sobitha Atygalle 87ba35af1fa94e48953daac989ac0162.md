# Sobitha Atygalle

Date: October 8, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Sobitha wants surgery. He has had a septoplasty sometime back by Naram and ? trauma by his son later on. Now dependant on Nasivion. Well honestly my examination was not that suggestive of a surgical problem. However he is insisting. I will be doing a combined surgery with Thushan Benaragama on the 27th. His mere chosing me is a great testimony. 

He said none of my post surgical patients has to come to him. And that he says is a greatest recommendation! 

I said I am honoured.
