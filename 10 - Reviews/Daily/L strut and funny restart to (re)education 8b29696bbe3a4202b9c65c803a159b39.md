# L strut and funny restart to (re)education

Date: May 19, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Yesterday as I listened to the discussion on teaching at Visakha class 8H, I reaslied what i needed to do is to approach studying in a Question and Answer format. 

I searched for COCLIA and started working on it. 

One of the first questions was on L strut. 

Then I went to live webinar organised by the Academy. Will you believe it is on the same theme and I learnt about the techniques on L strut preserving surgeries.

I think this is good start

Think like a student and learn like on
