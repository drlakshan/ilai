# Call from ProfJanaki Hewavisenthi

Date: November 20, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Got a call from Prof Hewavisenthi. She has spoken to the vice chancellor. They have decided to offer me an Honorary Senior Lecturer post. I was over the moon ! Need to prepare the letters appropriately and make sure that I develop myself as an academic!

Had a chat with JB about the reluctance of the PGIM to take in private sector teachers. No clear answer but he mentioned the blame is partly to be born by me as I have not actively searched for a possibility with written requests.

Also got to know about his gal lalla technique for recall of the lectures.

Bit similar to my S6 tab. 

Showed him Anki
