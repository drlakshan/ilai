Wesak Poya Dawasa
Buddhist Year 2567

![[Sri Lankan Calendar 2023.jpg]]


It a transition from old school thinking to a different world view
from the beginning of April when my attention was taken to my health conditions spinal cord and coronaries and went via Avurudu and Anuradhapura Pilgrimage and now Vesak Poya

As I was discussing with Apsara I will lead this bonus life as follows:
1. It is taken as a bonus , a gift to be utilised in a way that will benefit my Sadisa
2. Spiritual development is the most important goal
3. Passive income generation methods will be set in place that dependants are not burdened
4. Nawathma as opposed to Pawathma
5. Sathipattana Sutta is the key
