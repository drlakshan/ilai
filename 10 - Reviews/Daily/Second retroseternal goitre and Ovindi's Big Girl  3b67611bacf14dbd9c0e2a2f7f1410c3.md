# Second retroseternal goitre and Ovindi's Big Girl festival

Date: April 2, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Today is the Big Girl festival of my little angel. And it's the date I mark the second retrosternal goitre case with Handagala. Exhilarating experience. Now I am becoming a quite a confident and competent surgeon.
