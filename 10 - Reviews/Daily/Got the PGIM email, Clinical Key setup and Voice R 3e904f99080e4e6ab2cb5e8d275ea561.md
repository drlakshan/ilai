I think its a milestone. I got registered with PGIM with a PGIM email : m17843@pgim.cmb.ac.lk 

This is useful so that I can access Clinical Key with remote access using that email. This was indicated to me by Akram the other they during the Research Cartel discussion and I just applied via a google form and got the feedback. I didn't have to get registered for the training the trainers workshop to get the email however I might actually join it one fine day.

Need continuous be active on this learning pathway.
