# Palatal malignancy patient

Date: April 20, 2021
Signicant Event: No

Operated on a patient with possible palatal malignancy recurrence came with epistaxis and glue ear. Did a great job and she was very grateful. I was really afraid of the surgery as that may cause severe epistaxis. Although there was bleeding it could be controlled. So it was all in all a pleasant experience and instance where you burn your self to give light to a deserving patient.
