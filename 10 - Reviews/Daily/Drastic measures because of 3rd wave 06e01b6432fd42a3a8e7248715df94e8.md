# Drastic measures because of 3rd wave

Date: May 3, 2021
Signicant Event: No

Another rise in Corona cases in Sri Lanka. Not Yet locked down. But it seem to be coming. Even if the government will not impose locked down there will be a self imposed lock down by the people to some extent. India's situation is pathetic. I am slowly collecting the essentials to be ready. Skills to be learnt. Getting ready to be an author. I am a great online teacher now. Using the graphic designing skills to give quality lectures.
