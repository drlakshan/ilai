# Mother fell sick

Date: February 12, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

Usually unless she is really down, she doesnt call me. Yesterday she did. She said she is not feeling well. Apsara was at NHSL - a night shift, daughters with Latha, an online class was about to be started - I was late to help them out, patient related issues of appointments - pernnieal issues, then the phone rang. However was able to sort out the circumstances, and went to Kadawatha, she looked ill but basics were OK, liaised with Thushara, brought her to ETU, and got to know the pressure was 260/140 mmHg! That was probably the reason she was getting all those ill health symptoms recently. Did bloods - all came OK, including renal and HbA1C. I am relieved. On checking to see whether pressure apparatus is OK got to know that I have a slightly elevated blood pressure. Just confirmed it after a sleep and meditation session, still to be 123/90mmHg. Not surprised with all these happening around me! But this again pushes me towards my wider goal of Dhamma Magga.

Also noticed how clinically shrewd Sharma is. He was just spot on with high blood pressure diagnosis ECG interpretation 

Again felt the brilliance of my decision to join Nawaloka
