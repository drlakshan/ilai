Signicant Event: No

Need to take a stock of things. It would be best i think if i can start with the most widely important goals and work from that.

3. Physical fitness
    1. drift towards omnivorous eating
4. Practice 
    1. picking up 
    2. mentally and physically challenging cases popping up
    3. need to create an appropriate mentality
    
5. tendency to drift away from the software resolutions and hardware resolutions : should resist
    1. sometimes its a good thing for example had to change the mail app which wasnt helping me to Edison which seem to working fine so far
6. online teaching
    1. Kapruka order
        1. Apparently it is going to be taking a long time?
