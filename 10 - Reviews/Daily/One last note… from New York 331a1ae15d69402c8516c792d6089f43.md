# One last note… from New York

Date: September 16, 2022
Signicant Event: Yes

Now that American trip is going to finish today, I want to be a transformed person when I go back. How am I going to do that?

I am going to use Ikagai way priniciples and make sure that I stick to them.

I went through the principles of practice and decided to use the 7 virtues shown by Buddha in Kumbagosaka’s life. 
Question is how to put them in to the compelling score board

💡 If I can get a google form to fill in the details that goes to a sheet and on a seperate tab I can create some form of visualisation

In the NY JFK airport. Apparently it will take some time ( a good 3 hours before they accept us). Never mind I came prepared. I studied how the data visualisation can be done using google sheets. Now I have fairly good idea.
