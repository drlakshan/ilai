# Shouldn't Let it dry out - Nawam Poya Reflection

Date: February 26, 2021
Signicant Event: No

I notice a slight weakening of commitment to the Highest Purpose of life. This shouldn't happen. This is the crux of the matter. I would like to use this opportunity to reflect upon the situation and make changes in the way a sort of course correction.
We are creatures Of habit. I would also like to use this opportunity to sort of look back on what happened Recently. The number of hours that I have allocated for medication has come down. Reading of the Dhamma books has also come down. And the attachment to worldly things has increased. I am searching for worldly pleasures and in search of material gains vehicles and houses. 

This needs to stop.

I need to get the course corrected. And sure I can. As I have not deviated that much and I am able to control this. Planning to visit Damabeniya Rajadhani in the evening and will reset it.
