# Karmaya Rasweema

Date: December 15, 2020
Signicant Event: Yes

This is something I need to search and find an answer for. It’s really important how we get to know how this process is working. Unfortunately I don’t have a clear understanding as yet. Somehow I have a vague idea as to how this would happen. For example if we think about an object and this creates a mental Image, we associate certain mental ideations or formations based on that and when the object is presented to us either as a thought or as a visual phenomenon in future those feelings and mental formations that were originally created will flood to forefront. However this explanation lacks a few things. First of all I don’t see how it creates an effect or in other words - a viapakaya. Give me a fact that the consequences mini falls the strength of the original event should be also explained. I will keep on searching on this and update this page as I get new information.
