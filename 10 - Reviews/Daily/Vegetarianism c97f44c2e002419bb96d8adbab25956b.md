# Vegetarianism

Date: March 22, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

There was a great thrust from Mother to abandon it in favour of fish at least. Then can the deranged biochemistry reports. Accepted fish with reluctance. I am working with higher beings and I feel that I will be better off with vegetarianism if i can as I feel comfortable that way. I will try again with nuts and other stuff.
