# Correcting Ranputha's course

Date: May 13, 2021
Signicant Event: Yes

By exercising due diligence I was able to detect an unhealthy behaviour involving youtube and poor studying. Immediate course correction was done. Following decisions made

1. get an addon for Zoom MS teams etc to standard SLT connection
2. youtube only on the tv
3. search for the possibility deactivating accounts for a while
