Thoughts:

What I thought to prevent obsidian mobile note taking making changes on my laptop settings, I will enable receive only on the portable devices i.e : f42, pixel, and tab : they will just see allow me to access the work that I created using macbook air and the mac mini. The mobile devices will not create knowledge. It will recall them. Makes sense.

Alternative is to create different configurations for devices but why the trouble and I must force myself to use the more productive gadgets to engage in real work


Using Spar outdoor coffee area I am developing further

Its a new beginning. I came to the buisness center at on 320 it has the ambience I have been craving for. I am paying good amount of money for the facillity. So in return i am getting a distraction free workspace. I am thrilled. Hopefully I will use this new found treasure to the growth and development of my life.
