# Using the app with my new phone

Date: April 22, 2022
Signicant Event: No

I hope this journey will be fruitfuI

 Hope to use this phone as my primary driver for work and spare the iPhone for banking and other safety critical missions. 

That will hopefully help manage my economy better in this financially challenging times.
