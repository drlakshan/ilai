Thoughts:

# Financial Summary at the end of 2023

Financial Committments 40,000,000.00
Local Banking System 40,000,000.00
Assets 248,970,431.00
Using Assets not able to sell 25,000,000.00

Thats how it is. I can safely say I am financially independant
and at a untimely demise if it were to happen
250 M worth of assets are there for them
