Thoughts:


I have achieved great phycical control at the end of 2 months post angio. LDL 72 HbA1C 6.2, this is jus the beginning. I want to continue the good habits that made this possible, including walking, proper dieting and regular medications. Yesterday about 7 confirmations about the physical appearance, policeman, lab person, Sethummdi, Dr CAB, etc


secondly, I managed to create a working Google Suite and now I am printing my prescriptions. Need to Kaizen it and I will slowly but surely develop it.

UPDATE

Did a wonderful thyroidectomy. with very good feedback from Akram, updated the PMS to add surgery wait list feature. All the time keeping sathi nimitta intact. I want to Kaizen this Arabatha, nikkamatha, yunjatha Buddha Sasane [[Just shouldn't stop journalling 1e0e31d9fdd648f7a9bdf2d3d5f7cdaf]]
