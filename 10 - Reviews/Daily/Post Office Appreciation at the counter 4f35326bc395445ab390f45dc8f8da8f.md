# Post Office Appreciation at the counter

Date: January 26, 2021
Signicant Event: No

I thought I will make a small note on what happened today at Slave Island Post office. I had to post tax returns for 19/20 and I went to Slave Island post office. After multiple detours I was finally served and the person at the counter identified my voice and recognised who I was.

He was full of praise to the way I handled his son and was thankful. They are from Elpitiya and was not been treated well elsewhere. With one dose of my treatment the child has recovered. He got other officers to come and see me - his "hero" - in person. 

I realised now I am getting noticed in the wider public. and also my service is of good quality. I am very happy and the tiredness I got walking in the scorching sun dissipated with the showers of praise.
