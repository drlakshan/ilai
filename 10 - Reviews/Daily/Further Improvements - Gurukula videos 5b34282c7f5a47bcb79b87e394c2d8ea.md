# Further Improvements - Gurukula videos

Date: August 9, 2022
Signicant Event: Yes

To be better than yesterday.

serendipitously came across set of videos by Gurukula international schools about an “Ideal student”

five virutes

1. crow like persistence
2.  crane like focus
3. dog like sleep
4. moderate eating
5. brahmacharya

As I am a student myself these principles struck a chord. 

additionally the way the video was presented was also interesting. larger presenter and smaller area for the content.

Did a parotid and learnt how taking the time and meticulous dissection will bring great outcome.
