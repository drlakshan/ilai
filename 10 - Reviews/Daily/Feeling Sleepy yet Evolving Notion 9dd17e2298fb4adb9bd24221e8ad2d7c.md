I feel sleepy today. There was delay in going to sleep too. It wasn't a smooth transition. I was tired as well. 

I am evolving the Notion Second Brain. Was able to import booked and finished surgeries from entdrlakshan google drive folder as well.

Beautifully working so far.

Need concentrate on practice building section as well
