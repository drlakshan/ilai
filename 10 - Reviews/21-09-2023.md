Thoughts:


With this September revolution calmness is the key. Persevere
and try to improve. should I invite AI or not is the question. 
The best part of getting AI into the system is that it can digest and I can interact with it. It might give me some new connections that I did not know existed. But there is a huge downside. You are dependant on OpenAI. They will have the access to your data. That sort of defeats to the purpose of using Obsidian in the first place. Second there is the possibility of payments however small that may be. Isn't it same / similar as using power search to get related occurences and build it up yourself? For the moment I will stay as is.

What I can do is this. I will continue my chats and discussions with ChatGPT while keeping the Obsidian secure. I don't want any interactions with the vault by any outside party. Whatever I learn from chatGPT interactions I will feed by Obsidian manually.
