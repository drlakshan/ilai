# Thoughts



June 19th ; just realised that two years back I did a recall on juneteenth [[JuneTeenth.canvas|JuneTeenth]] . 
I want to [[HEAL frame work of making learning stick]] activity of couple of patient related achievements that happened today. 90 year old Royal Games master who successfully underwent sphenoid mucocoele surgery came for follow up and was really happy on the fact that he is now symptom free and thanked me profusely. additionally he invoked blessings of Samma Sambudu Saranai. This was a heart warming moment for me. All the operations and even relieving of aches and pains of all the patients I helped to get their suffering relieved made me a very powerful person in this samsaric existence.
