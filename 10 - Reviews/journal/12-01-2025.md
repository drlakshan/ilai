# Thoughts




I can and I will
starting with the mental devlopment
I purchased AI premium from Google with a grand plan 
lets see
I just did a deep research on hiccups and published on the website so easy and productive. 



so I created the NotebookLM for IRD as an advisor.

When the going gets tough the tough gets going right?

Apsara’s car got a minor scratch on reversing at her Nangi’s place. Not a big deal but I convinced her to think of Dhamma - what a noble way to sort out problems.

I came across this concept of talking to ai as a cognitive strategy especially for neurodivergent people. I thought that was fascinating as I used the same strategy with ChatGPT advanced voice. The sad thing is though I have a google ai premium plan the quality of interaction is just not there
