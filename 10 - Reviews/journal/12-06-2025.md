# Thoughts

what a  wonderful day. I got up at 4:45 as I had to a Thyroidectomy today. I was energetic as I had a nice sleep yesterday. I was able to go there slightly late but not that late. this is how the Kiri Mooda was displayed in the morning

Did a wonderful [surgery](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipN-VTf_njJD7xFQFNEdiaZCullJIBggSthW5dnf) taking time to do it properly. 
good outcome complete tumor removal and good voice outcome


Then did marvalous clinic session and got the blessings from the [venerable monk from Na Uyane](https://photos.app.goo.gl/frQDzjDV8L3JT4hn8) I wished to me in Metta whatever the life circumstances be when dealing with patients. 

Afte a very fruitful session, I went to ETU to help a patient with stridor and rested a little before I started the next session and after completion did a wonderful and fulfilling ward round. then I had a coffee with Akram and came home. Did a gym session and walk with Apsara and thought may be its a good idea to dedicate one hour for exercises and use the time concomutantly for YouTube and use the walking time with apsara for family discussions and the economical planning and things of such sort. 

then realised that I need to do some work at T3 and came got Vipula to do the pantry cupboard and got some photos of the sofa. and sorted mentally the mattress issue and electricity of Dambadeniya bill. Now I am typing this. 


# Updates

 1. I think this new routine is very useful.    Additionally, I would like to make sure that every time I do this, say for example, every day around 7 o'clock, when I do my jogging or walking briskly, I will listen to podcasts as a routine. 

2. I will use the walking time with Apsara to discuss family matters
3. I will try to get up at 4:30 every day
