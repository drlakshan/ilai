# Thoughts


wonderful day yesterday with research and publishing workflow
managed to achieve the following 
1. created accounts in arXiv medarXiv and openSF
2. created a substack and started writing most likely this will be my platform for forseeable future for writing
3. when the idea is mature it will be pushed to pre print 
4. finally to journals
5. created a claude skill using skill factory method to provide a properly formatted tar ball for the arXiv publication and it worked
6. I wrote my first manuscript using this workflow and there are great positives to it [[Creative use of git based workflows for knowledge users]]
7. tried to get endorsement from Jules White 
8. submitted to medarXiv
9. sent to Madwa chandrathilaka


I think this a pivotal moment. I have created a great workflow with huge potential and its a worlds first!




now we wait.
