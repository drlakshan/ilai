# Thoughts



Madin Poya
from February poya to this poya has been a challenging time. as I usually do I manage to take this opportunity and make changes to my schedule, learnt new things [[things I learnt during cervical relaxation]] and created strong thought processes. 

planned the routine practice from April 2025 onwards

now the next phase over the next 19 days, I will be optimising my Arogya, beloved project that has helped thousands of patients to enjoy a quality ENT service. I am planning to make it AI ready. 

One interesting concept I learnt yesterday is that more than the linear goals have a scientist approach to life where you devise small controlled experiments starting with observations and learning from the outcomes of the experiment in a[non-linear fashion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jC-MmDKk1CzzSD5csgt0p-iCuBWKunwfIHw3NE-pA30/edit?tab=t.0)

I like this mini experiment approach
