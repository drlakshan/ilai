managed to get everything working on the new I pad
When I want to type as I do here I can use the MxKeys best of the best (as is now) keyboard 
In combination with touch screen 
Lets create 
Actually create is the correct term
Because I believe now its time to give back to the society (world) by CREATING and my devices help me to create

The basic premise of the use of these devices is that the workflows should be solid
And the devices should work seamlessly
I am a thinker
And a learner
If I can use to create quality stuff with the use of these devices I can be happy
