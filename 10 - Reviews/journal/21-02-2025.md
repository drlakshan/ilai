# Thoughts


I am back. cervical relaxation surgery was good. I got immediate relief of some symptoms. Some symptoms returned. But I am very hopeful about the positive outcome. My idea of trying to get this fixed was to be of service to my fellow human beings by doing my pinkama. now that I have got the dangerous thing fixed, I hope i can continue to be of service to the humanity at the same time generating some income to my family.
