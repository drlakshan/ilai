Play vs Deliberate Practice. The author of the book I am reading these days on awakening the genius, argues that play may be better than deliberate practice insofar as deliberate practice tend to stick to a set of known rules where as play is done for just that play. He refers to a book by Atul Gawande on check lists and how they are important in averting disasters too. I believe when we are doing high stake operations, it may be best to be on deliberate practice pathway at least initially and at the same time keep a playful mindset at the back.
