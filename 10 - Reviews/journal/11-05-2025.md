# Thoughts


72 hour Vesak centered 
Self development is initiated
I want to be in solitude
The ideal solitude
Mental toughness and character development based on Buddhist virtues and giving me the superpowers to the human centered delivery of ent services 
I became aware of my own reluctance to go through the pain, the necessary discomfort of trying to relive someone’s suffering. It’s not about me it’s about them. 

I am doing ok when it comes to the service delivery I know that for a fact, I am very helpful to my patients and I don’t want to stop being helpful. But I would like to stop being too sensitive. The limited life I have I will try to use for the relief of suffering of my patients. How about trying to emulate the life of Jeewaka the royal physician?
