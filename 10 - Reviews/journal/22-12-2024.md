# Thoughts

I miss my MBP, however good the the Ipad is there are certain workflows i will miss if i stay only on the Ipad. being a poweruser and the Maiten bag by side I should be able to have my electronics available for me wherever I go. I will take out what is only necessary and then work from there.

There are myriad of ways to think about AI and way forward. Let me craft my own.
