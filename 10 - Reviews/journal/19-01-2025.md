Nutrition lecture was great






sorting out the mess of file systems and inability to access my obsidian knowledge
this is what I have achieved thus far:

# Ways to access obsidian knowledge


1. obsidian vault is syncing with google drive. that is working perfectly
2. its copied to the professional account as well
3. some of them are copied but not all - as folders cannot be copied
4. i have created an appscript script to copy the content to a google doc so that I can access it via notebookLM
5. now I have following ways to interact with my obsidian vault
	1. via obsidian
	2. via cursor on MBA
	3. via notebookLM via MBA, Web, Iphone or any device **new
	4. via google drive on desktop or web




a great quote I came across is this: " Never let a good crisis go to waste"![[Ernie Chen's Blog_May 2021.jpeg]]
