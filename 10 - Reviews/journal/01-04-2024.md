# Thoughts

I feel better focussed. I am improving my panchabala as a preferential way to walk on the path of the Dhamma. Slowly but surely I will reach there. 

Planning to visit a workshop today on AI. Hopefully that will enhance my interactions with AI. 

Contemplating buying Perplexity Pro subscription. What I feel will be useful are following
1. ability to re write using multiple LLMs
2. ability to create collection


I’m pretty serious about artificial intelligence and improving my life with it. I think I can do it, and I will use this tools, judiciously, and extensively and improve the things that I would like to improve.
