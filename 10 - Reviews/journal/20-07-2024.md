# Thoughts

Esala Poya

2 years back on an Esala Poya I had mentioned about Indrakheela, renewed interest in buddhist way of life [[Esala Poya Revolution 2022]] One story related in that journal article is the story of Velukantaki Nanda Matha a lay desciple of lord Buddha with great qaulities [[qualities of Velukantaki Nanda Matha]]


With the help of these note taking methods and artificial intelligence strategies I am developing myself.

Three visualizations: mental development, AI development, and ENT development as the cruxes of the matter


With Kaizen [[Kaizen Technique]] that happened over the last month or so I am developing in leaps and bounds

Recently there were some thought provoking incidents happened; including a purported missed piece of coconut shell. I will face all these with calmness, intelligence and fearlessness' (wow that is so profound!)
