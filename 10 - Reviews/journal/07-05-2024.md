# Thoughts


I am not feeling well. difficult to know why, whatever it is, I know the solution. Dhamma.

Planning to have a meeting with Kalum for Dhamma and life
Both aspects of life (worldly and spiritual)
Need to sort out the money situations the ways to invest whatever is earned 
Is it gold? Is it cash? is it realestate

Another is the concept of solitude
worldly and spiritually 

Is it giving up everything and retire?

How am I going to spiritually develop

It is a fight I need to fight alone.
