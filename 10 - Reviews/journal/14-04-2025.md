learnt another "definition'  of success [[marc cormier ted talk on "peak performance mindset" TEDx talk]]



1. outcome
2. perfomance
3. process

the value of the proportion is dependent on the time of event
e.g. at the time of the Olympic Race : outcome and the perfomance is relatively more important than the process and the fundmenals


e.g - A healthy mindset balances all three layers:  
  - **Process** (e.g., studying daily).  
  - **Performance** (e.g., improving exam scores).  
  - **Outcomes** (e.g., passing the test).
