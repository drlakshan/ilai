# Thoughts


Signing the rental lease document for [[On320 T3B2a]] today to a [Chinese Tenant](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XtsyPlvBBeUSYUrxfCoMIscYRSKo9L4lTAjr71sR72Q/edit?usp=drivesdk) today. Although these are financial achievements - the burden associated with them are sickening. This again proves The Perfect One is correct and the aphorism "Thanhaya Jaayathi Soko". However when we are living a worldly life these financial burdens have to be born and taken up as a challenge. I need to work up some plan about the tax issue. may be a candid chat with Prof and or chairman would be useful. Lets think about it.
