# Thoughts


so here we are again 
went to the cloud, oracle --> google 
did some work 
realised if its AI experimentation that you need to do vertex ai would be better than a VM machine I was trying to built
but what I realised is that the output from the perplexity was so good. it appears managing spaces in perplexity and using notebook LM seems to be the best way forward at least for the moment. 
if you want some barebone work curor beats the hell out of vscode with those extension as is. 
do not try to re invent the wheel
you learnt some geeky stuff. Just let it go and do the work that matters now.
