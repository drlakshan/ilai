# Thoughts



I decided to go ahead with the surgery and did the following
1. get the trello board revised
2. informed immediate team
3. informed chairman
	1. that was a nice chat, he wanted to come down and meet me to discuss
	2. he offered help
	3. he also agreed on my plan
4. informed Prof Lal Chandrasena
	1. good news or bad news
	2. came around to pat on the back
5. informed Sharma
6. Piymini cried
7. Dr Sunil Perera called today on a (Nawam Poya day) and he agreed to perform surgery next Tuesday
8. moving forwards I will be discussing the finer details with Wanigasekara Ayya and organise
9. Need to support Apsara in this difficult time.  she finds it difficult to balance work and committing to my care. 
10. Since Tuesday is chosen for surgery I can do the following
	1. do the AI lecture this Sunday
	2. perform surgeries for the asking patients
	3. get the rest of the work done and dusted.
	4. anti-platelet stopping is adequate
