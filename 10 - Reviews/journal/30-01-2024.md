# Thoughts



Very clinically oriented day. Have to do two surgeries in the morning FESS an a Thyriod in the morning and two FESS cases during the lunch time.

I am preparing for the oration as well. 

I want to reflect a bit on Cough Interest Group Meeting. Al lecture. I was very transparent and showed off how I do things and how things can be done. I felt it as a unidirectional flow and was not feeling very good about it. Is it because of my own problem or theirs I do not know. 

Need to create an AI stratergy
Need to finalise the Oration slides.
