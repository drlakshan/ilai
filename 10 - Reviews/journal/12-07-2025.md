# Thoughts


Last day in Vietnam 🇻🇳. Thought of jotting down some ideas and thoughts.
First thing I realized is how fallible the human mind is 
It is just thrown away and swaying left to right and it runs haywire
Samadhi bhawana and reaching dhyana status offers a temporary solace but it is not a solution. Reaching the ultimate status is the surest thing. However progress over perfection is the way forward.

I had the good fortune of listening to [[Great Ariyaparyesana sutta discourse]] on Esala poya day. This discourse summarizes how the Perfect One changed what he was searching for. From Jathi Jara Marana Causing Dhammatha to Nibbana. it talks about noble seeking and ignoble seeking. It talked about following teachings of lay teachers and understanding that is not what He was seeking, it talks about the immeasurable suffering he went through and then most importantly having the courage to change and give up what is accepted as the norm and pursue what he thought was possible. It also shows the path of liberation via samadhi Dhamma. This also was an eye opener in the sense that I was able to think about what Maiya always talk about.

Got to know about Ovindi’s result wrote a letter and there was a dip in mental status and quickly recovered. Wrote a letter and encouraged her to move forward without being bogged down.  Knowing her intellectual and psychological capacities I am pretty sure that she will come out of this rut pretty fine

Let’s type this now using my iPad  and continue my reflections

I enjoyed Vietnamese food very much. Flavorful, tasty and many textures liked Phin coffee as well. Lots of healthy options. Moderation small portion sizes.


Relaxed attitude they have about life

Resilience they showed when battling It out for freedom from French and US . Complicated history yet something minimalist about how they go about doing things.

About material possessions : how trying to stuff up is not the best way to solve problems. In fact it is the opposite what can I give up or give away to bring about the mental calmness that we all strive to achieve. 


Had the time to listened to many Dhamma talks including ආනාපාන සති Anapanasathi Bhawana. 

Learnt about and practiced stretching as a wonderful form of physical exercise

Learnt and though about[[ cognitive debt]] the now famous MIT paper.

Something to be aware of and something to consider when directing my Ai pathway.

Became friendly and at peace with my iPad. Not expecting it do what it is not envisaged to do by Steve Jobbs and keeping the tactile interactions with it as much as possible and consume and create aspects to go hand in hand. Tuned some settings and it seem to be at the right amount of usability at present
