# Thoughts

Learning langchain and related python and stuff. Slow but steady. Sometimes I wonder why. But I think I will just do it simply because I want to create something. With the help of these software tools, I can create my own software which might be useful. Clear thinking, clear writing, prospection 
[[PRISM acronym for positive work culture]]

It’s pretty obvious at least to me mobile phone or portable secure computing power with functional apps will be the way in the future. 

My entire automation has to be through the phone. Obviously iPhone at present as others failed to deliver. Pixel!
