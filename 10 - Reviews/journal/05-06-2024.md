# Thoughts


I am developing along "Indrakeelaya" pathway. Now for the last 3 weeks I have been working on this starting properly from [[13-05-2024]]

It seem to create a great sense of well being. Lets fine tune streaks app that will help to continue these core principle habits. 

Additionally with the start of Columbia Endoscopic Ear Course from today, I want to do proper course related note taking effort. The reason why I want to do this is this. with the current state of Obsidian note taking, I can create search and update myself without doubt. for example lets say I want to revise for the endoscopic ear surgery with stapedectomy, my process is as follows:
create a blank. note , start search, powersearch and stange new worlds and see. Other thing I can do is to start with an outline of things I need to have there and fill in the blanks. This active recall method helps. Howevder, when taking notes on a particular workshop how best I should do that is not really worked out. Something to work on. I tried hashing for the AAO HNS

I think this is all that is necessary. create a template file for the course and use it extensively link to other notes as I do anyways.
