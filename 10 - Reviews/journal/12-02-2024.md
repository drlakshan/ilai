# Thoughts

Scientific Lakshan program is progressing. 
I delivered a stellar presentation at the CORLHNS oration and despite the emotional breakdown people loved it. 
I will progress in this path slowly but surely.

Chairman Dr Jayantha Dharmadasa offered a director post. 

Time and Focus Scientific Lakshan!
