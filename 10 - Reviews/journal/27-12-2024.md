# Thoughts


This nonsensical.
I need to stop trying to get the perfect tool finding hunt right now! This is taking way more time than needed this is also distracting me from my main work target. 
Lets not waste any more time.
Its the Ipad PRO that's going to be with me every where I go

Now that I got that finalized please do not change this setup

Just stick to this 

This way I can use the power of the IPad and MacBook Pro combined
