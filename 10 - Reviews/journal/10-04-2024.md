# Thoughts

Looking at the Indian Ocean from my apartment balcony and thinking of the fruitful evening I had with my family last night. Ovindi was very open and forthcoming. We discussed "me time". I proposed the need for a family dinner time. Optimism. Hope and love. 

So with the upcoming annual break we are going to leap forth with new found wisdom. We will kaizen [[Kaizen Technique]] our lives. 

I came to Hilton Basico for a coffee and a mind dump. I want to kaizen my life. On the way, I met a gentleman (Mr Glenn) in the lift where we discussed about what we do and could brag a bit by saying I am walking to Hilton for Coffee
