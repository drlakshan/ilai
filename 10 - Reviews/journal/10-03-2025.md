# Thoughts

over the next 22 days I wil be fine tuning the Arogya services with AI 
I will be AI ready and my ENT practice will also be

the ability to develop and deploy REACT apps and n8n ai workflows can supercharge my functions. Additionally with AbacusAi I have the access to major foundational models and Gemini Advaned though health.lk subscription. So the ground is set. Slowly develop. Festina Lente [[Festina Lente]]


Important consideration I need to revisit is the mobile computing. I tried, MacBook Air, pro and last iPad Pro, obviously iPad gave me the weight advantage but not the power advantage

and also with the laptop stand, this seem to be the most ergonomically appropriate too. 
only problem is the weight. macbook air typically weigh 1.29 Kg as opposed to 444 mg of Ipad Pro 

this weight difference is huge. 
And also please consider this too; what are you planning to do on the go. browising, journelling brainstorming : all these can be done with the phone too. so. again ipad is becoming redunant? lets try NOT to carry anything with me for the next 3 months.
