# Thoughts

reintegration into society and work has to happen now
I feel I am physically ok despite having feet numbness etc
what to do?
need to pick yourself up from what you have and do what I need to do
remember my greatest enemy is not my competitors but re-injury itself. 

I have read about psuedoarthrosis and making an effort to mitigate it



5pm Update

last evening of the cervical relaxation
had the neck fixed, mind fixed and slow return to work is the plan
had a chat with Chathura
couple of thoughts and ideas that I thought important to note
1. Karaneeya Metta sutta 21 day recital. I think this is a very powerful habit that I will use. This will protect me and hopefully let me achieve what I intend to achieve.  [[Karaneeya Metta Sutta Meaning]]
2. chulla setti jathakaya and business managment how a person who sold a dead rat and became a very wealthy person thinking statergically using sound business policies
3. the fact that [[16-08-2023#Siyalu Buduwarunge Anushasanawa]] all four lines propose ACTION something do
4. I emphasized Bhawanawa as the way forward
