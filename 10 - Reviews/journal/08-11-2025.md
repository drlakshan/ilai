# Thoughts


couple of realizations over this week. 
1. take control of your brand : you have power to do things. people will resondate. DO not think twice. just do it. have the mission at the back of your mind. its not to get everyone to love you. it will never workout. work on you and your mission and ignore all the rest. 
2. be ruthlessly indistractable. its ok not to answer calls whatsapp messages if i am not very keen to do so. I have to do the work. lets do it. 
3. again Its not about me. its about the patient. so when and if a patient is not better I do not have to start on a negative stance. I just can start with compassion for them, its about them. not about me. some illenesses cannot be cured. I dont have to own it.
4. Kasun can be helpful to create Arogya AI. lets brainstorm about it as well.
5. regarding tax payments: had a chat with Apsara. I will pay. reasonably and I will be creative and intelligent. lets work on these. 

I managed work on my git workflow. I may buy a KVM device with a view to approach it from anywhere from the world. I think thats a great idea.
