re. state of obsidian

I don't think this koofr thing is working however much i tried
I am sure if i try again and again I can achieve it but is it worth it?

I will keep on working here in my macbook with synchronisation to Koofer
and lets see how to get to mobile in couple of weeks later


a good AI workflow:

	1. perplexity
	2. google deep research
	3. deepseek
2. feed to notebooklm
3. output to google suite then work from there
