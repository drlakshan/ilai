# Thoughts





this is it. over the last couple of weeks along with my efforts to deliver a lecture at CCP I managed to review my AI workflows and optimise them to a great extent. I think the level it is at is of VERY high quality. There are bug and flaws I agree but the foundation is laid. after completion of the Claude Code course now I am fully committed to the following workflow.

1. My note taking will be in the Obdidian using markdown and canvas type files. I will visualise and query existing notes [[ways to search in obsidian vault for knowledge]] and create a mental representation of the concepts. 
2. I will then create a note based on my thoughts on the scrachpaper.md in the /scrachpad After fully formulating what I have may be using the Clinical Assessment framework (History, Examination, Differential, Investigations, and management plan forumulating)....
3. Wil use either inbuilt cursor ai for chat, or call in Claude code and do interactive learning
4. I might get external help in the way of digested stuff from NotebookLM, youtube transcripts, copied text etc and feed them as source material to the scrtachpaper serving as a temporary placeholder
5. I have also created a learning revision pathway [[ENT-Revision-Curriculum-Mapping]] I will start learning and making notes along the way
6. Over the next three months:
	1. there will be proliferation of atomic notes in the vault with the help of learning and reading
	2. refinement of claude code commands that will be used as limited context helpers
	3. multiple sub agents will be deployed
	4. best of n method
	5. multiple answers to be considered and then come to a solution as an explicit stratergy will be employed

"All these to create a charachter that is a learning machine; learning how to learn and using AI to enhance my existence and service to manking [[my pinkama]]"
