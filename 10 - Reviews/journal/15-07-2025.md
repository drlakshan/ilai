# Thoughts


Post Vietnam 
Esala revolution that happened in Vietnam [[Great Ariyaparyesana sutta discourse]] is reverberating in my mind. Perseverance in Dhamma Magga with principled and simple living is so energizing . As intentionality is now fully baked into existence, I become all the more powerful. With all of the passing experiences I go through I become stronger and lighter at the same time.
During the lunch break yesterday I could not rest I wanted to go get my daughters. One physically ill and the other mentally so. Ekkenek Gathen Leda wela anith kena sithen Leda wela. 

Additionally I took the family out to one Galle Face yesterday. It was great to ventilate feelings. Got gifts to daughters and made Apsara and them really happy.

I had to be stern in the morning with Apsara to make sure she doesn’t unnecessarily suffer.

Managed to visit Sarasavi, Knick knack and dinemore without disappointment and was able to finish asset declaration and application for re scrutiny and read an important piece on Karmaya. 

So it was an extremely productive day.
