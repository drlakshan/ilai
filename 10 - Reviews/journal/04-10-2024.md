# Thoughts


today is the 3rd day of the morning offs scheduled because of Sandeep Sharma's absence
last couple of days were helpful in following manner I just want to jot them down

1. I got Benz battery changed along with key battery change
2. I got the Nawaloka phone to give me the necessary data when needed, gemini live to operate besides me and access google drive for important obsidian related stuff
3. I got the obsidian workflow to happen seamlessly so that I do the typing and work only on a computer and can access via iphone and any other internet connected devices but wont be able to edit. I think that is fine. I would like to use the computer to work and collect data as fleeting notes on google keep and process the throughly before they enter my obsidian knowlege1 vault. 
4. I decided and practiced on following tools
	1. google keep
	2. notebooklm from google
	3. gemini live
	4. claude pro subscription was taken and cancelled immediately
	5. Need to have perplexity going on its a good investment. however before restarting I will keep it on the free version for a little while. 


5. i will be planning the financial pathway as well
	1. cancelled chatGPT pro, perplexity Pro, claude Pro 60USD
	2. cancelled coursera Plus 50 USD
	3. 

6. managed to run an agentic workflow using crewai on google colab wonderfully went on
7. reading on nawaloka phone
8. vertex ai learning.
