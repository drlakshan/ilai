# Thoughts

Wonderful Pooja at Wadihiti Kanda. The chief prelate Whom I operated upon (Parotidectomy ) was very keen on organising the pinkama. Stayed at Hotel Tamarind and worshipped Kiri Vehera and Kataragama Devalaya overnight. Today on invitation from the Chief Monk we went to Pooja. There were two actually. We were taken up the hill by his double cab which was far better than the average cabs and was greeted and looked after extremely well by the monk. First Pooja was at the kailaasana temple where I was taken in the temple and individually blessed upon. That is the actual place Lord Kadasurindu meditated. Then we went to another temple where I was again taken individually inside and kept at the entrance blessings awarded. At each temple respective priests blessed the entire family by name. As this fell on Minudi’s birthday she was specially blessed and monk remarked that the gift I gave is the best possible gift as far as the blessings go. I thanked the most venerable
stating the following “ mage deviyo lagatama gihin vadinna laba dunnata pin”. 

Need to capitalize from here and work in the new dimension.
