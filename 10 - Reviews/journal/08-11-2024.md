# Thoughts


Life is getting increasingly distilled
Finding ways to minimize chaos and streamline processes
On the Ai front again this trepidation has arisen 
Should I follow the traditional path so that I get a paper qualification and a more in depth teaching or use contemporary “algorithm helped” learning
As I type the solution just come to me it’s glaringly obvious USE BOTH 
May be investing for coursera plus when clinical workload is less and learn as fast as possible would be the best way.

Let’s do a typical work week time block and arrange for a way to get this done
These are the key components 
1. morning daily routine with Indrakheeka prathipada with aramunu pihituweema
2. Morning walk for 15 minutes
3. Evening 30 minutes gym
4. Two clinic sessions of 3 Hours each
5. Surgery sessions 2 per day 12 to 2 and a 4 hour on Wednesday
6. Planning session on Sunday Morning
