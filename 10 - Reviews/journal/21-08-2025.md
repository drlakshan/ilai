# Thoughts


moving on from yesterday, these days I am concentrating on the purpose of work and what should I do about my work, 
its clear that I am trying to avoid being helpful out of fear of damage to ego, not merely because of others. thinking that its not about me helps 
more than that, there was a great realization yesterday when I thought about the Thrihethuka pinkama, beginning, while doing and after doing, I should be meritorious, and intelligent. then the outcome is extremely powerful. 
first I need to think whether I really belief Lord Buddha's teaching SHRADDA. If that is perfected to the level of BALA then th viriya sathi samadhi prangna will fall into place. 


so my pinkama was and will be my ENT service, lets do that Thrihehukawa.
