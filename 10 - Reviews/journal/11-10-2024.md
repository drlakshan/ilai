# Thoughts
Today there is a new addition to my digital armamentarium
Ipad Pro M4 
Hopefully this will sort out my backache woes
How i intend to use this is as follows:

1. set it up a powerful digital assistant. 
2. creation hub
3. as it is portable I should be able to take it with me everywhere I go. 
4. now the most important use case getting by obsidian vault synced through koofr
5. I will achieve the Human 3.0 status danielle meisller is talking about

It would be interesting to know how I should proceed with developing my own identity on the web.
