# Thoughts



progressing in AI learning pathway. we had a discussion (Lankitha)
who pointed out this interesting concept of learning from youtube, medium and reddit. because their algorithms will bring up latest before formal courses come up with. I have started learning on coursera plus subscription. I think a blend of formal and informal is important. simply because foundational level knowledge gives a grounding and above three resources are giving me the latest.
