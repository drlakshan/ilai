# Thoughts

too much coffee?
Anyway feeling good. Some work got done. registered for the Columbia Ear Course sent a message to Madawa about possible academic work in AI and medical education, got codeum to work in visual studio code etc. 

Now to serious stuff. I am on a mission called "indrakeelaya" : backed by the preaching of Ven Ududumbara Kashyapa thero, and using Buddhist philosophy to enhance mind " Chiththan Rakketha Medhavi"

what should be my next steps now that Edmonton Rental has been organised
Immediately I realised that I wanted to update the finances calendar so that I get a reminder event every month for these things. And did that!

Now I realised that I need to create a presentation for the Kurunegala Medical Society.
