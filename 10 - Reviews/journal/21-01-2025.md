# Thoughts


today is grand day. 
started around 4:45 
got to know Sudu Chooti was OK despite Api seethale gasemu gasemu..
went to Visakha with the girls and Apsara
Did a great Buddha Vandana at Vajiraramaya and worshipped the greatest Intelligence of Lord Buddha
had a veg breakfast Amrith 
Had a great blessings from the first patient, incidentally wife of BOC DGM with teary eyes

Then opened the NHREF today where I got an office to work. this is a great begining. I will use this space to learn and improve myself. 

started work with Akila who seems to be an intelligent fellow.


got to know Sudu Chooti has become the first in the Class again! 
need to do the blood tests but she seems to be OK.
