Sorry I had to miss the Dhamma discussion with Venerable DhammaSudharatha thero

Couple of reflections on to practice

1. Handling of submandibular stone removal patient’s post operative care [[Submandibular salivary stone management]]
2. Was able to intubate stiff neck patient when a cardiac Anaesthetist couldn’t. 
Kept composure all the while handling my success and challenges 

Came to reaslise the importance of not giving speed and time
