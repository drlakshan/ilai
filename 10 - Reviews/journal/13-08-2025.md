# Thoughts


lets give n8n another try 

i am having some reservations though. will it deliver? will it be a waste of time? in fact I subscribe to the notion that “what we have with Ai is an integration problem”

I had a thought experiment about this while I was at One Gallface and I think the most important realization is automation can be done however if it is a Google service dependent for example Gmail or Google sheet google drive it is best to use Google script if I need external services, for example WhatsApp is best to useN8n And see some big feeling bit adventures these days I would like to try out the second option for a few work flows and see how it goes. 

Additional realization was that it is always best to have a notebook and a very powerful phone with access to latest models and AI That will be more useful than a computer.
