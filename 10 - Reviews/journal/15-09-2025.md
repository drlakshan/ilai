# Thoughts



Now that the thinking /learning workflow using Ai and obsidian is more or less formulated I can now slowly build upon this. two major components are obsidian and gemini CLI. there are other components that I can bring in to the table but those two are the crux of the matter. I will slowly refine these tools over the time to bring about best thinking I ever had.
