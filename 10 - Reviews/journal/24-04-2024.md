# Thoughts



Post Bak Poya. As per previous resolutions on tiny habits [[List of Tiny Habit Recipes That I would like to incorporate - April 2024]] decided to do the academic writing tiny habit.

I have a video conference at 9am SL time with a patient in the Maldives

Arogya : my practice software based on Google Workspace is taking shape. Not only I prescribe using it, email, medical certificates, referrals, feedbacks, video appointment scheduling, google meet, appsheet and apps to send links personalied welcome emails, google site for the website and google reviews with buisiness hosting. So simple but effective use of technology.



Last sprint on the Bak Poya went on well. Managed to get SMS and email notifications working 

How did I do that
for the SMS , viewed couple of tutorials and practiced on APPSHEET and got to know how to create REF relationships between tables links to send and the patient information table. 
For the emailing created an appscript to get triggered off with the new row entry using the "e" parameter and then worked on how to send inline images. Finally had to use blebs and programmitically in put that.
