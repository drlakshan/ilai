# Thoughts


A new beginning as a director of my hospital.
and also there is some URTI sort of infection going on in the family. My mother is happy to come over and look after and this gives me some time to be off family commitment and there are low clinical commitments as well. This is an ideal opportunity for self development. I am contemplating pancha bala vyayamaya. in this exercise I will develop my 5 mental skills I am very keen to develop. Shradda, Viriya, Sathi, Samadhi and Prangna in the day to day living I am practicing realisation of dichotomy of control. and thats it. 

In the professional sphere, I have come across the possibility of using ai in a huge way to improve my communication, my professional development and financial gains. At the same time I feel a heavy heart. I need to improve my self with growth mindset and I will.
