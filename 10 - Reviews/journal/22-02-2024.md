# Thoughts


need a full revamp
I want to start all over again.

a full inner organisation
Lets take a look at
1. my [[My Widely Important Goals]]
2. my [[My core values]]
3. my [[My Strengths]]

I believe consistent baby steps is the way forward.
I have limited time in this world
I will practice couple of habits and fill the awake time so that a happy satisfied life can be achieved

I will focus on developing communication as the key skill development
when you say communication what are the areas you have in your mind?
1 Emails
2. Presentations
3. Patient - Doctor encounters
4. Board Meetings
5.
