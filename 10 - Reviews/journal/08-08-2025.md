# Thoughts


Sudu chootis Birthday, Poya Day The day I am going to meet my Kataragama Deviyo in Kataragama. Taking the family and staying at Grand Tamarind Lake. There is an invitation from Vadihiti Kande Loku Hamuduruwo as well. How I see this is as a milestone in my life. scientific lakshan program that I started on the Duruthu Poya 2024 ( 19 months / Poyas ago) has slowly but surely porgressed through lectures, panel discussions, couple of publications, NHREF head position, pro subscriptions of Foundation models, coursera plus subscriptions, relentless attempts in to charcter developments [[seven timeless Japanese thinking patterns that will help me craft my ideal life style]] etc. incidentally i have presented the program to Kirivehera and Kataragama Deviyo at the beginnig. [[25-01-2024]]

this new concept of symbiogenesis I came across while listening to an [excellent TED talk](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/ffad9987-7e17-4e2a-b9e8-eb29b3e14ff3) gave me an excellent dimension about AI-HUMAN interaction. Just as mitochondria got incorporated in to eukaryotic cell and became an organelle, artificial intelligence will find it way in to our collective intelligence and transfer much of its intelligences "genes" into human intelligence, by the way is the collective intelligence of all humanity not just one. the fact that i have always said while operating its not me it is the collective, the engineers who came up with these machines and who created these drugs, universal conciousness. we are all connected and evolving. ![[Symbiogenesis_ Evolution of Complex Cells.png]]


another huge realisation I had was that the endgoal of all these interactions should be to train myself to think WITHOUT any digital aid. sounds counter intuitive however it is simple. trained cognition or the mind is what you carry around with you wherever you go. (mano pubbanga ma dhamma - buddhist philosophy and buisness acumen, entreprenurship creativity .... convergence), so with this symbiogenetic relationships there will be an exponential growth in the thinking process. starting with the baked in cognitive biases checker - like the Kautilya project and analysing stuff through notebookLM and documenting these in obsidian and getting AI search and synthesise new knowledge and neural pathways. keeping up with the [[deliberate practice|what is deliberate practice]] principles, the best way to achieve the true potential of the mind growth.
