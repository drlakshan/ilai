# Thoughts

Today is the day I started practicing Sathi Nimiththa  proper
After listening to the motivational and inspirational sermon by the most venerable Ududumbara Kashyapa thero I decided to start the mental development program with great vigour.

I have dedicated next couple of days to develop following
1. Mental strength : Meditation 
2. Physical strength : stretching and walking
3. Social Strength: Improving communication
4. Professional Strength: Incorporating AI to patient management

I have also decided to name this endeavour "Indrakheelaya"

In addition I got the new dell ultra-sharp monitor. Its fabulous
