# Thoughts


I think the learning workflow is pretty solid now
I will start with a scratchpaper 
1. first do my work for about 15 minutes
2. create my notes thoughts in the scratch paper
then I fire up cursor and get claude opened. 
using scrachpaper as the basis
	1. I can expand 
		1. if I am using google search I will run GeminiCLI first
		2. if I am doing a pubemed search I will use Claude Code and MCP to search for it
	2. I can use mind maps etc as well
	3. If I think I need to do a deep research I will take two reports from Gemini,  perplexity and ChatGPT in the future may be from claude too in to NotebookLM and study there for a while expecially using a mindmap
	4. take all the learning to scratchpaper
	5. from there I create atomic notes, canvases and flashcards
for testing myself purposes I have a board review notebook prepared where I can pitch my knowledge against. 
Once the work is finalised in the scratchpaper I will update the vault





since this is happening very rapidly there is a coginitive load and need to balance it 
may be go slow
