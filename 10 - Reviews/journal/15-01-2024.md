# Thoughts

Wonderful yet frightening experience with vertigo. Got the first hand experience of how troublesome symptoms could be and how effective the Semonts manuvre was. It was actually [[Semont Plus Maneuvre]]

Also studied a lot with the patient with Grdenigo and the need for the research on vertigo. One important, actually two important things are happening in parellel these days
1. I am reading the book Awaken your genius and 
2. Getting ready for the AI lecture for the interest group meeting.

so this is an optimal time to think about the learning aspects as well

With the vertigo episode, i had to think of the various health related concerns all over again. This included how to manage my finances. There is a sense of urgency to simplify and to realise. There should not be any hindrance to others when I am gone.
Finances should be easily handed over. may be in liquid form [[Investment Instruments decision making.canvas|Investment Instruments decision making]]
