# Thoughts


After deliberations I had recently on various matters, especially on the philosophy of life and character building, following is the idea I have about how to proceed: 

It’s going to be rooted in the Buddhist principles. No surprise there. However the realisation is what to do. Or how to practice it : as to practice margaya I will stick to the Pancha Bala - Pancha Indriya concept. [[My 5 principles and practices of character building]]

When I do that I can practice [[stoicism cardinal values]] and be mindful of [[Stoicism dichotomy of control]]


For me to practice these stoic principles I need a foundation and thats what Panchabala will do and much more (going beyond  having practical wisdom, courage, justice and temperance. )



So from this moment onwards I will be concentrating on improving these indriya dhamma with iridipada.
