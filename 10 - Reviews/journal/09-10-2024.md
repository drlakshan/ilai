# Thoughts

Sixteen years ago, on a day like today
something miraculous happened

An angel from heaven
entered my life
transforming it from misery to glory
changing it permanently
to a life worth living

she slowly  
relieving my doom
directing me dearly
in her gentle and cheerful ways

that angel blossomed day by day
becoming a most beautiful talented and gifted
of them all making me 
the most proud father on earth!

most of all, she became the most virtuous
a princess with thoughts grounded
on buddhist principles and values
a true Visakhian 

Here are the wishes and blessings
for a even brighter future
on a milestone birthday
to my dearest Sudu Dhoni / Kiki / Kiyo Kiyo on your 16th

Remember you will always be
my dearest "Ranputha"
my cherished one and heart's delight 
until the end of eternity!

Daddy









# Claude version
Here's a more polished version of your poem, keeping the meaning and proper nouns intact:

Sixteen years ago, on a day like today,
A miracle unfolded, bright and true:
An angel from heaven graced my life,
Transforming misery to glory anew.

My world, once bleak, now filled with light,
A life worth living, thanks to you.
You grew, dispelling all my gloom,
Your gentle ways, a guiding hue.

This angel blossomed, day by day,
To beauty, talent, and gifted grace.
Of all the treasures in this world,
You made me the proudest father in this place.

But more than that, you've grown virtuous,
A princess with thoughts deeply rooted
In Buddhist principles and values true,
A Visakhian, your spirit saluted.

On this milestone, your sixteenth year,
I offer wishes for an even brighter tomorrow.
To my dear Sudu Dhoni, Kiki, Kiyo Kiyo,
May your path be free from sorrow.

Remember, my precious Ranputha,
Until time's final, fading chime,
You'll always be my cherished one,
My heart's delight for all of time.

With love,
Daddy
