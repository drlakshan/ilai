# Thoughts





We stayed at on320 last night. It was a good experience but I felt how great Edmonton is. The facilities and space is better. 

I also realised that I need not run away from Colombo to get relaxed. I have my own hotel room. Plus I could do this with other Colombo based hotels

I also added two important features to Arogya. [[Roadmap for my pms]]  ability to enter individual drugs and ability to add information leaflets to the prescription email. 

Had a swim too 

I feel good about how this is progressing. 

I meditated too. 

Next couple of days I have no surgeries. Can use that time for studying organising and development. 

Things can be done

1 American academy video repository
2 Satish Jain dissection
3 Practice development
 Website updates 
 AROGYA features and optimization
 App development is it needed. I think yes because it will be faster
