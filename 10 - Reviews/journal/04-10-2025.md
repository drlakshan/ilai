# Thoughts

the sprint has begun 
over the next 72 hours I will lift up my AI game
I will do clinical work no true blackout there
however I will season improve and expand my processes
lets start two youtube videos on pituitary surgery

I did another transphenoidal surgery with Dr Himashi kularatne
went on rather well
opened from BOTH sides this time 
septal handling need to be improved
lower edge cleared
