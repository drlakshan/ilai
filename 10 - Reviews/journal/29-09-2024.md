# Thoughts


Basically I am revamping my whole digital life. 
1. using arc browser that helps me to focus and get things done using ai.  
2. Using VScode as the launchpad for workflows and thought processess
3. Using GPT4 advanced voice as the preferred way to interact and learn
4. using smart connections to activate schematic processing of the memory grooves. 
5. using tools and environments approach to productivity
6. Using Google Drive as the preferred collection bucket of digital assets lakshent as the personal and lakshan@health.lk as the professional. this dichotomy I hope will help me to simplify my life
7. I am getting ready to be a 50 year old. 
8. Indrakheela prathipada building up: in fact I can do the visit to the vipassana centre today
9. raycast as the preferred way to interact with the computer
10. finally remember everything should come back to obsidian The Vault.
