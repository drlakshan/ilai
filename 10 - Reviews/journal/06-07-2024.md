# Thoughts


Bit of a confusional state. How to proceed over the weekend; options

1. Brandon's course watching and practicing a few things here and there
2. Dambadeniya estate
3. Ranputha's maths class
4. Minudi's tennis 
5. Nawaloka work
6. Economic assessments
7. work on Arogya




# Daily questions

Did I do an ANKI ? #didIlearn:
Did I practice a growth mindset today? #growthmindset:
Did I consume mindfully today? #consume-mindfully:
Did I sathi nimiththa today? #panchabala:
Did I walk and stretch today? #exercise:
