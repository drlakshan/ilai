# Thoughts
[[Baddeka ratta sutta ideal solitude]] came to my mind. When using these devices for productivity something profound has to be kept in mind 
That is why and how of the utility 
The way then iPad is used is different to a MacBook Pro 
And the things and the way the workflows should run must take into account the unique features of the device. in IPad it’s the touchscreen and the Apple Pencil 
I think I am on the right path, Most important softwares I am configuring to work on the iPad and the rest of the platforms, like obsidian, Apple notes, zotero, things, Freeform, google drive and.  Calendar apps
Hopefully I will be more productive
