# Thoughts

How do I blend my core Buddhist values, character building with stoicism is the question

I believe developing four cardinal values [[stoicism cardinal values]] and dichotomy of control [[Stoicism dichotomy of control]] are really important in practical sense. I felt it. 

However I don’t want to live a life which is superficial. I like the fact that stoicism values virtue as the central tenet of existence. Not the pleasure. Although I had the idea that we shouldn’t go after sensual pleasures I thought the happiness is the life’s goal and that made me a miserable man. Now that I know it’s the virtue it makes enduring unhappiness including pain and possibility of death, acceptable. 

But what is this virtue? How does is defer from Seelaya? I think this where Samma Dittiya comes in. 
I need to develop set of values that will give meaning to the term “virtuous”.
