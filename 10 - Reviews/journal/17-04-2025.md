# Thoughts


17th. we are slowly moving things over to Pinnacle. some more things to be organised. I think those will happen over the next week due to Avurudu holidays.

there are some health related concerns but i think they are not major.

With the greatest Avurudu break ever I am equipped to achieve great heights.

why do I say the greatest Avurudu Break:
1. I have reduced work so that I can enjoy more : this is partly forced (due to cervical fusion)
2. Stay at Damabdeniya : meditation at the Kutiya and Wijesundararamaya
3. Ruwan Meli Maha Saya meditation 
4. Jaya Siri Maha Bodhi Punyakalaya 
5. Performing auspicious time rituals 
6. Ganudenu kireema with BOC, and Gangaramaya Loku Hamuduruwo
7. Gangarama Wandanawa and Blessings from Kesha Dhathu
8. Sathi Pirith chanted oil as a powerful thing to be with you
9. Changing living space from AirVillas to Pinnacle
10. with that minimalistic living approach









- 21:23 need to learn to live with it : idea is that although my space is limited by the fact that size of the table over shadows the room, I can live with that. and I need to.
