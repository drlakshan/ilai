Thoughts
-  I need a solid AI foundation Not something half baked. got really disappointed with how google workspace extensions fail to deliver. Google being goolge expectations are high
- what I think will happen in the future is this
	- things will become better on Google Side: but I do not want to wait or pay meanwhile. 
	- I will use fabric [[fabric use cases - a great ai tool - may be the best way I am going to use ai]]
	- I will use [[openWebUi with openAI API key ]] cheaper without paying perpetually 
	-  May be I can stop paying for perplexity as well
	- I will use ai studio / vertex studio and the like to digest and create content
	- Now I realize OpenAI playground would be the best place
	- I will stick to obsidian to get very simple and valuable atomic notes without bombarding will all the information of the world
	- Notebook LLM works as a the scoped agent at the moment but I will have to think better about it. 
	- May be use the OpenAI assistants
