# Thoughts


One of the things I see happening with obsidian is that I trend to document life as a journal more than using it for knowledge work. 

True there is a relationship here the domains but I always wanted to keep them separate. That is because all those connections become more useful when it’s subject specific but it may be more meaningful when everything is connected. I don’t know. But I feel it’s better to have them separate.
