# Thoughts


A wonderful beginning with the new set of IT gadgets. I have got a new macbook pro yesterday. combined with the recent purchases of the apple watch series 9, airpod pro 2nd generation, Iphone 14 Pro, now I have a complete set of updated hardware to enhance my output in a great way. 

What is totally surprising is that, I got software updates for the macbook pro, watch and the phone today too.  It was like a coordinated upgrade both software and hardware. 

A rare combination of hardware and software update.  
Its not over
This is the break created for the improvement of Scientific Lakshan program and tomorrow is Duruthu Poya

Lets do the work 
my work is my "pinkama"

This bit I am trying at Gangaramaya 
Had a great Buddha Pooja 
Meditated. And thought the following 

1. Sathi Nimitththa improvement will be the main target spiritually 
2. Making a single Anki Note will be the task on education 
3. Completing walking and stretching exercises would do for exercising
4. Mindful consumption will be just that
5. Reflection is just that too 

Great start after meditation session at Gangaramaya. Lets continue this journey helping others.
