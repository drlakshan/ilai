# Thoughts


Typing away from Nilaweli beach hotel.
clearing out so many false beliefs including typing is inferior to writing 
In an unrelated note, I recently discovered that low level of reading is not a product of not using paper version (over electronic version) but because of poorly formed mindset. Once the mindset is shifted it doesn’t matter whether it is paper or electronic, all you need to do is to go on doing it.

Coming back to the point, this vacation was planned sometime ago with the whole purpose of having a quality family time together rejuvenate and comeback to work/life. I booked Rajarata hotel there was a Boc card offer , and Nilaweli beach hotel. One of the realizations was that the patients that I have treated are really grateful to me and they paid me back in kindness.
