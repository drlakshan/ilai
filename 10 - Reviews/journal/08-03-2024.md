# Thoughts



Today is Mahasivarathri day
Recently there is increase / surge in spiritual practice in my life.
I want to use this day to enhance / heighten it.

one of the things that I intend to do is to have a zoom meeting with Sathi on Meghiya Sutta [[Megiya Sutta]]

second, I want to expand my YT journey. Lets discuss the pros and cons of the personal vs professional google account

Today I will relaunch my digital business strategy 


Another worshipping by a patient and the family : post mastoidectomy : how grateful they were.
