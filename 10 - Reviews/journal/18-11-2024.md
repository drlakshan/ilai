# Thoughts




You can not plan anything but planning is everything 
What should I do? The neck is playing up. 
What are the things that I should consider now?

Health 

Should I get another MRI
?neurosurgical opinion
?neurology opinion
?ugie
Admit and do?

Work
It’s clear I need to limit the work or at least plan it with regular breaks
Please don’t compare 
Think of the posture and ergonomics
DO NOT carry heavy stuff. That includes computers

Finances
First get the current situation assessed
Then think if income flows
I think the most steady flow is the channels 2.6 M 1.6
Surgery fluctuates 25 to 50
Other income sources are 
Plantations
Rental edmonton
interest in FDs
dividends 
Director salary? 50k 
Resident salary 4k
I think the monthly commitment is around 2M 
Let’s check the loan commitment and investment commitments then work form that

Loans commitment was around 950000 last December and now I have added another 600,000 on top of that for another 10 years, after 2027 again it will be less as commercial bank loan get settled, and at the end of 2028, Edmonton is settled as well. So this is the height of loan commitment 1.6 Million.



I think the more underlying issue is Sachiththa pariyo dapanan. How I can develop myself according to Buddhist philosophy 
Meditation
Sathi nimiththa
