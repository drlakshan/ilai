# Thoughts


finished the college oration last night,

In preparing for this, I followed the following approach
1. application and abstract preparations with the help of chatGPT after I have done the details 
2. citation was created by chatGPT when the current CV details were sent. This was actually noted by the President Ravindra Kirihena
3. Data mining and processing partly with the help of AI 
4. Thought about the process for a while before creating the slides at the last moment. [[Endoscopic Ear Surgery Oration.canvas|Endoscopic Ear Surgery Oration]]
5. First did the slides on google slides and then moved to Canva
6. realised that large video files may not be swiftly displayed due to connectivity issues etc.
7. was able to export the slides on powerpoint format without any errors. 
8. edited videos for brevity and clarity. 
9. flow was modified multiple times until I got it right 
10. cannot be 100 percent sure that things are completed as we may like to  go back and do more editing 
11. Used the presenter view with notes effectively
12. Although I printed them out a. they were not formatted b. I left them behind anyway
13. came to love the font "Inter" color theme finalised
14. now I have created a folder for the oration and uploaded everything there with a document for canva theme link[[canva professional presentation template link]]
15. found a problem with spell checking when using canva and used  grammerly addon for that.

Preparation went up to the last moment and was able to get the family there nicely dressed

Although the presentation went on well, I had an emotional breakdown when I was thanking my late father. I felt embarassed but now I think that made the oration even more memorable.

Lets start all over again!
