# Thoughts
greatest meditation and morning routine day for a long time today. 
got to know both girls have done extremely well in their exams. particularly nangi has surpassed all those scholarship girls and become second in the class. akka is shy to say she is the 5th but that's a great achievement in the midst of very bright group of students. 

I am going to utilise the time today to achieve the IT proficieny I always wanted to achieve
