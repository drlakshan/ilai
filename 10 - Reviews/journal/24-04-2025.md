# Thoughts

it is really important that I consider ways of maintaining this simplified version of life that I so dearly crafted during cervical relaxation. it is important that Do not over complicate it. And equally important to include things that I wanted to be included like meditation, exercise and time boxing. there seem to be huge miss on these things. lets engineer those in to a practical and beautiful life. 

additionally I have come to realise that communication learning as a science is extremely important and worth spending some more time

another revelation is that LLMs as teachers and for the purpose of learning than doing things for you. its bit controversial but worth thinking about.
