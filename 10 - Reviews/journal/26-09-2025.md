# Thoughts

basically over the last week or so, I created a significant number of new notes

I want to showcase my learning workflow to dr ruberu
Obsidian
Cursor
Gemini CLI (and claude and codex)
creation of atomic notes
how they are visualized and assessed
how new knowledge is discovered 
how seamlessly get integrated
