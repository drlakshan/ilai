# Thoughts

what a wonderful start
Ovindi Kiyo Kiyo is starting her Advanced Level Educational Journey
we got the blessings from Sri Dalada Maligaya Kiri Vehera Katharagama Devalaya Wadasiti Kanda and meditated and weathered through tough times with equanimity
learned and practiced Japanase mental models [[seven timeless Japanese thinking patterns that will help me craft my ideal life style]] and [[wabi-sabi ]]


Lets take this opportune moment to kaizen our lives and take it to next level
Theruwan Saranai Devi Rakawaranai


Kiyo had got up at 5 despite sleeping late and was the first to get ready
we had a buddha pooja at home and then at Vajiraramaya and Visakha Bodhiya. I invoked blessings to everyone after Karaneeya Metta sutta chanting. 

Recently most of the notes in the vault has been daily journelling and thought frameworks. Or not I wrote a few things about complications of FESS didnt I?
now what I need to do is to practice these timeless Japanese thought frameworks and develop my character. 

slowly but surely we will proceed.
