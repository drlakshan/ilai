Biggest point i want to sort out is the ai usage in my obsidian vault. I have struggled so far with smart connections, copilot and smart second brain plugins; Here are the observations:

1. using local models for privacy is great but serious performance issues arise; sometimes making it impractical to move on
2. using propritery models I don't feel comfortable becuase I have sensitive data in my vaults
3. for perplexity i get a 5 usd credit anyways because of my subscription and can think of using this for local 

I think the most feasible solution at least to get the sensitive information like mura pada in to a vault of its own and keep local 
and then use the rest of the vault for processing




8:00 PM Sunday 2024
After going up and down to and fro, i decided to use following for my AI settings within the obsidian vault

plugin : smart connections
API : openAI API 
at present i had 1.64 USD balance
after the initial embeddings and couple of small queries it went down to 1.58 i.e 0.06
