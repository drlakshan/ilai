# Thoughts


this is it. I am committed to slowly improve my processes. 
I will make sure my finances and other activities will flow like a river, and I am agile like a martial artist
calm, intelligent, fearless
started day with a marvalous Buddha Pooja, yesterday too at Nawaloka Bodhiya. This year I have been visiting this place rather more frequently It is my easiest accessible place for worshipping.



i am further refining the process using macbook air, calendar and things
another note

slowly but surely I am improving
