# Thoughts


Lets see what this does. I have started using the typewriter mode plugin for obsidian
I dont know whether this is useful
It seem to be so
Learnt quite lot about zotero 7 and updated 
incorporated Koofr for storing webdav format.
seems to be working fine but the megasync is syncing as well,
lets see how things unfold.

this is great. I am focussing on the line I am typing and the rest just move away. what a wonderful plugin! I got an idea, one fine day I may thank all these creators by contributing to their accounts in what may be a small contribution but for me its a way of showing gratitude,


1. want
2. do
3. become
4. result

the above is the classical way of trying to achieve things
what if we[reverse that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp6DJQhNKrs)?
1. result : what would be the end like?
2. then become that person
3. and do the things that person will do 
4. and then achieve the specific thing that you can have.

basically its visualisation the end as in my case Indrakheela prathipada
and then achieve that [[Baddeka ratta sutta ideal solitude]]

this is a great way to think about things. and lets try to achieve that!
