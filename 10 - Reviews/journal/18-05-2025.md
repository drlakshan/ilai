# Thoughts

Need to plan the day today
its three months after [[things I learnt during cervical relaxation]]
I am lucky to be able to function the way I am now. and lots of merits to Dr Sunil Perera and my family and the team who stood by me during this difficult period. I always thought about that period of constructive reflection and refocussing and I think i managed to pass that period quite well.
