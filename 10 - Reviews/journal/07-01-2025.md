# Thoughts


Went to meet the Deputy General of Tax at east gampaha regarding tax amnesty issue. Discussed about the issue and I explained to him that there is no wrong doing and I don’t think I have to pay anything extra. I don’t know how this will work out.

I have to think now. I am typing this at Marino Mall. Now having a cappacino a moment ago a cup of tea. I know I am crazy! Am I ?

The need to sort out the financial mess and plan a way forward is a top priority 

Here is the plan

Daily make a note of income
I don’t think I can hide the echannelling income. So no point in even trying . Unless I go for alternative methods of collecting that is unprofessional and un ethical. Further more I need to have some money on the accounts to balance the loan commitments. 

[[Current Loan commitments]]
So about 1.5 million I am investing for my loans. Therefore I will have to show close to two million anyways. If I see average 1000 patients a month that will be 2.5 million income. So comfortably i can cover investment Lon requirements and credit card requirements.  
Let’s check last three months credit card spends
I just realised that since I am paying 40% if I earn 2.5 million it will be exactly 1.5 and the rest (from out patients surgeries bank interests etc) for living expenses 

So next up is to create a loan calendar 

I think  it is better to get advise from a reputed tax consultant and learn myself too.
