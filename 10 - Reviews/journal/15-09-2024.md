# Instructions
I want to decide on the best way forward with my google worksuite usage
# Information
## Context

I have a Google One account and Google Workspace Business Standard account ( I am the only user I use this for my patient care requirements)
I also use a markdown editor - Obsidian where my thinking happens.
My notes and journelling happens inside Obsidian
I have couple of other google accounts that I keep for teaching etc simply because I dont want to log in to my personal emails on public lecture podia. 
Now I am in a  mess with these accounts,

I want to have a clear coherent and effective workflows and ideally I should save money too. 
I have some concerns about the quality of google gemini ai where I tend to use perplexity and chatGPT more for research and content creation. I have also noted that interaction with gmail, drive etc are not optimal as yet but I believe they will become better with time. 

So I need to decide on how to use these technologies and accounts to deliver a quality service to me my patients and the country. 
Help me decide.
