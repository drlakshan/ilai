# Thoughts


New beginning as a director from today. Yesterday chairman came and met me and wanted to invite me personally to the director board, I had to ponder for a while had a long chat with Apsara and Amma and got advice from couple of people and decided to accept the honour. I will take this as a positive new beginning to my life. From my humble beginning to where I am now. Got the blessings of Gangaramaya and will do what ever it takes to deliver the best to the development of this institution

Went in the morning to Gangaramaya with Apsara
