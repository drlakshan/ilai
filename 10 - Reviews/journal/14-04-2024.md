# Important Goal Orientation
First note being written from Sanctuary Anuradhapura 
I went to Maha Stupa and Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya and meditated. 
I thought of the following
1. Spiritually : I will be practicing Pancha Bala Anapaanasathi Bhawanawa Tiny Habit related to Abipammodayam Chiththam [[Tiny Habit  -1 Strengthen the mind - Abhippromadayam Chiththam]]
2. Physically : Walking and stretching as the preferred mode of exercise 
3. Professionally : Will be Enhancing Arogya and AI Obsidian and Zotero to achieve this [[Tiny Habit -4 Academic Writing]]
4. Financially : Gold and Savings 
5. Being helpful for sadisa 

Will use tiny habit system to design behaviours slowly but steadily.
