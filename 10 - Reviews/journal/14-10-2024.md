# Thoughts

Planning and implementing a simpler lighter (literally and figuratively ) workflow using iPad M4 
Apple notes seems to be the way  forward to capture note and make some super useful research data collections
Learning the ropes as it were 
Reading books on the iPad is very easy and fun 
I think I am reading more and getting the hang of it 
Hopefully this is not a temporary high that I have got.
