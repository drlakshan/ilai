# Thoughts


Its a wonderful day. 
i started the day with visuallisations and acting on the new git based learning pathway. 
saw patients with equanimity
I am on a mental training practice.

I will slowly and surely develop
[[Festina Lente]]

additionally I am planning to hold a Bodhi Pooja with my ENT team at Gangaramaya tonight
Idea is simple yet profound
my service is a Buddha Pooja its very demanding yet rewarding
like lord Buddha sacrificed so much for our delieveance I am happy to weather all the hits and rise up 
additionally I want to invoke merits to all the pioneers in medical technologies and Information technologies who made it possible for me to deliver a world class service. 

what a wonderful Idea.
