# Thoughts

New beginning at Tower 2 
got up at 4:12 automatically.

starting today I will focus on my mental development followed by other lofty goals. All I have learnt including [[things I learnt during cervical relaxation]] will be utilised. Time boxing will be continued. 

I will maintain a list of things that need to be done and slowly and tactfully approach life.

Hiccup patient was a mental stress 
Thyroidectomy was a triumph

Came across this YouTube video
