# Thoughts


something really beautiful happened
I came to Nawaloka Temple and worshipped on my way to do the Parotidectomy. 
I have now new ritual where I contemplate on Pancha Indriya and Pancha Bala and 4 components of each and make a adhishtana to improve that. As soon as I did that and opened my eyes, Buddha Poojawa was made ready and was about to be offered. I was so happy how the event unfolded. 

these days I am contemplating on the surgery, post operative period perop etc.
For what I do as a surgeon with highest possible skills, I need to look after my spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. Though there are known risks, ACDF is an established surgical procedure and by undergoing that and if it becomes successful, I will be able to be of service for a longer time and I will be symptom free as well. if it doesn't go according to the plan, I will somehow manage. I am a person who has risen like a Phoenix many a times. And when I make a decision considering all possible data, I will execute it to the best of my ability.
