# Thoughts


Thinking of taking mom to Vietnam. 
Got a travel agent to organizing the trip details, including Visa hopefully we should be able to realize and proceed with the trip and come back with my brother. Let’s see how this unfolds.

At the same time, another significant development is reading the book called Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. 

The beautiful thing about the book is that the first opening sentence which goes something like this I can think, I can wait and I can starve.
