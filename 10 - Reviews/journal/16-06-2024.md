# Thoughts



is Patience everything? I seem to think so

Wonderful call from Sathi, when I was distraught unable to move anywhere stuck with python coding and setting up enviorenments, I just went to a close by coffee shop and then I got a call from Sathi, sending me the number of Pradeep Python developer who pointed out that it may be best to just use a cloud jupyter notebook. I had some early success with that and I happily jumped onto it.!
