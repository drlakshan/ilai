# Thoughts

Sunday recap
I managed to revisit and reincoperate spaced repetition back in to obsidian
the tedious part of creating the flashcard notation was handed over to custom gemini CLI command /flash cards command
this is great news as the spaced repitition is the missing link

I met some batchmates last noght at the batch gettogether. there was lot of praise and appreciation particularly from GMOA president Dr Sanjeewa Thennakoon who praised the work I do from the private sector, One important realisation is that I am developing an antifragile charachter that is not dependant on inflation of the selfworth balloon based on external validation. 

explored the concept of claude subagents. good but not that essential I feel -at least at the moment. may be in the future.
