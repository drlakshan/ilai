# Thoughts

the day is getting closer.
 need to make final decisions and informing. 
this is the most crucial decision in my life. 
As I have already made my decision I am happy to proceed. Then there are concerns from Lakmali, and then Tiran proposing Singapore. 
I will listen to the little voice in my head. 
First of all stop asking for opinion from everyone. you have got the concerns and opinions and ideas from everyone, now I need to concentrate on what I feel and decide.

First Do I have symptoms? If so are they significant enough?
Do I have a significant pathology
Do people who know about the condition have a clear plan of action?
Can you trust the surgeon?
Have you made arrangements?
