# Thoughts


Tried to incorporate google chat into Arogya with a view to develop a mechanism for my patients to contact me. then soon realised it need a fully fledged website due to privacy concerns etc. Then realised that the effort is sort of pointless as the interactions with the patients are minimum. 


Now I have settled with Google Group as the community. People can opt for membership and if they have queries they can raise it though that. That way I can have all value added services available in my google workspace be available for all my patients.
