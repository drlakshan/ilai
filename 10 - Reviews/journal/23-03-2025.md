# Thoughts

It was a great [lecture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KMdCgklA0zPzkXyk8kwAOz0O-AGedikH7Q89cD4ilw0/edit?usp=drivesdk) I delivered at AAS and it was well received.
I think it is best that I delve deep in to timeboxing disregarding all the ills. 
over the next 15 mins

1. time box for management meeting and board meeting
2. time box for check deposit
3. create a[[ color code for time boxing]]
4. look at documentation for google appscript
