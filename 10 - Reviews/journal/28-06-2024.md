# Thoughts

Indrakheelaya unwavering effort continues
Important thing about this path is it isn’t tiresome. 


Update 15:15

Both my girls have got excellent results at their term tests. 
Ovindi’s teacher has searched for her and asked “so this is you” and has said “you deserve it”. She is very happy. (This event may be slightly different as my memory of events are not the best to say the least!)

Anyhow, I spoke to the head of exams British Council and arranged for further learning for her

Minudi has done exceptionally well too

My girls are studying well

That’s a great thing. 

IT wise arranged for tailor made coding next door
And spoke to Sathi’s contact Shanuka Karunarathne another useful resource.
