# Thoughts

another day. or is it? life changing day? the numbnesses I had on the finger tips are no more. should I proceed or not. 
when it comes to problem analysis
[[Polya's problem solving  model]]
so the unknown is whether this is the best thing I could do to my tissues. I feel yes. Because I get the symptoms and better to give me the best possible chance to fight it out.

Update @11:11 pm

Met Dr Sunil Perera and discussed. 
As my tingling have improved I was having a trepidation about the continuation of the surgical plan. then I made a decision and informed Sandeep Sharma, Miyiurangi, Amma etc that I am not doing it tomorrow. 

Now 

1. I need to get the practice back on tract again and then plan 
		1. get the channels up again
		2. surgery reschduling
		3. check about the payments
2. Get ready for the cervical relaxation second phase
