4. As soon as it finished I had to go for the board meeting: towards the end of the board meeting NHREF came up and was able to give a great concise introduction on that.
5. As soon as I finished got to know that there is no transport available for Ranputha Ovindi to come and I quickly went there, picked Apsara on the way. 
6. went back to work with a 10 minute shut -eye cant call it sleep for sure.
7. then came back to the rest of the clinic
