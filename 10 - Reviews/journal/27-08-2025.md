# Thoughts



there is a plethora of videos on how to integrate AI to obsidian note creation and knowlege management
Although people use AI to either speed up or to do a "better" job at creating a comprehensive or fully formatted notes, I think that sort of defeats the whole purpose of having a digital note taking system. It is for the owner to make the note -not for the AI to do that. Having said that that there are definite use cases I can think about that might ENHANCE my thinking process

there was a great one hour [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7Pb73dbcIM&t)  on 10 workflows one might use for claude code and obsidian integrations. [[10 workflows claude code and obsidian interactions - youtube video]]
