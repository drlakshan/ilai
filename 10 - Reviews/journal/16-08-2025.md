# Thoughts


In Kandy on invitation of Kosala Rathnayaka
it was a great experience. 
Set off from on320 at 4:30 got up at 4:00 collected family from Kadawatha. I was chanting Pirith all the way. including aarakshaka gatha [[aarakshaka gatha]] kept composure. came to his place on time was welcomed and were offered breakfast. (a breakFEAST) then was take to Dalada Maligawa and was able to worship the temple of tooth relic very elegantly and grandly. Meanwhile got an alarming call that there is some bleeding from the nose of one of the patients and was wondering what to do. with the help of Sharma and Eshani managed to sort it out. and the real help would have come from Kataragama Deviyo. Then visited the was museum and had a lovely lunch courtesy of Kosala. he was profusely thankful  for the surgery and was delighted that his voice is back. we felt special and the he said that the chief monk usually do not offer the gift that I was received.

Then the KCC. KCC GM Thusitha has alerted on of the official to welcome us and were offered free tickets to Clarance Rhythm of Guitar movie. Incidentally it was the 50th day celebration and there was a cake cutting etc. So much happening.

But the take home message is this. It is the pinkama that I do and need to do in the best possible way I am doing. True there is a HUGE mental stress to me. But I will take it. That is the way to look after the Sadhisa and at the same time get the best merits possible as a human being.
