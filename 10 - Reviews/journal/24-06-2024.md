# Thoughts
persistence in indrakheela program 
I once got the idea purportedly from Novak Djokovic where its not the attempt never to lose focus but ability to try and refocus when you loose the focus that is important.
I believe that
when you try to pick from every failurem the neural pathways of recovery attempt will become stronger and that will ultimately create the mental strength that you desire.


All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better.
