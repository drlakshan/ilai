1. Re. Pharmacology Opportunity
	1. need to do a significant presentation as there may be future opportunities stemming from this
	2. need to plug in NREF as well
	3. I have started work on the canvas [[canvas pharmacology lecture.canvas|canvas pharmacology lecture]]
		[[learning and practicing medicine when AI is in the equation - my Ai course for medical students and professionals]]
	1. think of more creative ways I can present this so there is a lasting impact
	2. create an article if possible

2. Dambadeniya Rahadhani Kuti
	1. need to fulfil the missing items and arrange for proper utilisation
	2. can use the travel time to think and talk to my self
	3. AirBNB opportunity
3. Other opportunities like Sangakkara data use, VR program we need to slowly take in
