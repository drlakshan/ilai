typing away at Pizza Hut at one of the busiest times when an offer going on. 
but I can work. in the brain coffee is doing its trick. Future of work is being mulled over. 

I want to communicate with my post op patients. one option is email for seeing how they are and may be to send videos. other option is to give a video call. may be both. I can get my assistant to speak to them first and ask and schedule a video call to see how they are. They will really appreciate it! Then I can send a post op care email. May be create templates for pot opt care. e.g septoplasty myringoplasty.
