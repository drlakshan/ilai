# Thoughts



great! now that raycast is doing most of the things that i do on the computer with perfect harmony I am really happy. 

additionally and more importantly I decided on my surgery
what I hope it will do is release my nerve roots and the spinal cord from the pressure exerted
this will hopefully enable me to work for a bit longer and be of service

there are pros and cons to the surgery but I am going to go for it
i need to be able to work for a bit longer and be of service and doing this will enable me to do that
now that I have made my decision, I will have to plan for the surgery and the recovery
lets get the trello board imported in 
https://trello.com/b/9303c1sd

Here is a list of tasks that require my attention
1. before surgery
    clinical work organisation
    financial organisation
    adminstrative organisation
2. plan for the break and see whether i can achieve a great outcome
    consider AI integrations
    improve Arogya Platform
    think of the Arogya AI helper agent that I am thinking of
3 Plan to be even healthier when I comeback
	diet 
	exercise
	financially too
