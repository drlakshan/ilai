# Thoughts

some form of schedule is emerging. after getting up with morning rituals, some stretching exercises are performed. then i help with schooling etc then I go to a coffee shop and brainstorm/plan then timebox for the day. and execute it. in the evening around 8 i go to the gym for about 25 minutes. then relax and do whatever. this is a good schedule. 

lets think about AI and how I can incorporate Ai again. 
lets take terminal patients bilateral abductor palsy.
