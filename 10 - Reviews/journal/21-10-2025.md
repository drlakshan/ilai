# Thoughts



some more improvements in networking and tailscale applications. got to know about how to host a Searchxng on a VM machine and use tailscle to talk to it, A fun project and acutally it can be very useful privacy wise also. got the idea where I can ask the gen ai to teach me networking and may be limit the time as well


second thing about this claude skills and I following this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_SL0FaY8MM&t=164s) on how to get claude skills at scale
also following UCDavis course on agentic development

let me do this

1. first priority should be to finsh UC Davis course
2. create a network teaching bot
3. replicate the searchXing thing


Update

I learnt about MINIO s3 bucket architecture and why it can be used as a google drive alternative and create a private internet for me
additionally I explored some tailscale deployments very helpful
and claude skills generator that seem to be woking well
and with that I got to know how to use that as a way to give claude skills that may be really useful
