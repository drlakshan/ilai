# Thoughts


Got up at 4:27 without an alarm and though could not immediately get to work I meditated and strengthened mind. [[Tiny Habit  -1 Strengthen the mind - Abhippromadayam Chiththam]]

Next couple of days has a hiatus that I may be able to utilise to create the next phase of my life : The Director/ Senior Consultant / Scientific Lakshan / AI Thought Leader

With the help of new found tools, both software and hardware, I will achieve what I need to achieve. these so called achievements are judged by the usefulness to others.
