# Thoughts

what a terrible state of affairs
uncontrolled mind
169 Random Sugar
Netflix proving the status of mind
it is clear there is a long way to go
and am I ready to do this?
who am I 
why does the nature of things still unsettles me? 
what have i learnt?

one of the first things I should realise is that this is exactly what the Exalted One explained the reality of the unaccomplished mind
the very nature of the unattained mind
and why I should not work heedlessly and why I should be careful 
let all other existence be there as they are 
let me work on so called me. 
I am bout to die
lets finish the most important mission of all time.
