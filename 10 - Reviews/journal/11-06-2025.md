# Thoughts

yesterdays appreciation by Kalum - my patient I operated for a vascular lesion on the nose is really overwhelming.  The event was held at Peddlar's Inn at the Fort hosted by the patient and the owner of the place (a cool guy staying in Germany - usually) 

This actually helped clarify my life's existence. I am here to heal. heal with compassion, at the same time burning myself at past now with the comfort zone
