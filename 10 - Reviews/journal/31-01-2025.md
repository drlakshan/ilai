On the 29th Morning I had a severe vertigo on waking up. It was classical BPPV symptoms. I did repoisitioning manouvre and carried out with my work . Three surgeries. Clinic . SO I was impressed about myself and I was happy how I was battling these off

I had some preliminary discussions with Wnaige ayya about spinal cord compression. I might have to undergo surgery.
