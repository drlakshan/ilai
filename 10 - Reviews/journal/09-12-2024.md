# Thoughts



50th Birthday
Survived for half a century
I am happy of things I have achieved academically, professionally, financially,
Spiritually I am very much advanced honestly, but I will work on that bit more from now on.
When the awake time was dedicated to academics, profession, and financially establishig by self, time was spent  on those. 
However I have NOT neglected mental training. I knew how important that is. 
Its just that I will spend most of my time on that.

Financially I have passed 5Kg thats a milestone with other #property I have achieved. 
I have looked after my mother, brother, my own family, my patients, and everyone (sadisa) with great care. i have looked after all those are travelling with me in this samsaric exitence including the unseen.


Now I can rest content knowing that I have done enough.

Lets focus on mental training.
