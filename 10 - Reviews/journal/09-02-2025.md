**Thinking process in Dambadeniya**

#journal 

  

I came to my Rajadhani Kutiya alone

This is the most calming serene experience ever!

I am feeling very happy and relaxed

My symptoms are better but I know there is a significant problem that I need to sort out

I spoke to Wanigasekara Ayya frankly about my Neuro surgical situation and I think he agrees with what my decision is. Now as it stands I will meet Kamal Ayya tomorrow and get the NCS done and make my decisions based on that.

  

  

Meanwhile I will continue to do my pinkama. 

In fact come to think of it, all my work is to do sadisa namaskaraya right? That includes parents, family, friends, servants and subordinates, teachers and clergy. Additionally I need to mentally achieve my calmness and serenity. After purchasing Kadurugahamula Watta and now completing the building of Rajadhani Kutiya now I am mentally progressing. This is the place I get my mental power. Where I plan my strategy and relax.
