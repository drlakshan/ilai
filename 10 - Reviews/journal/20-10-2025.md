# Thoughts


current state of affairs with AI
now I have my central knowledge hub in S3 AWS which is being synced across 2 laptops iphone Ipad and macmini
I work with that using GUIs in all except macmini which works as a headless server. 
It serves primary function of giving CLI access to iphone and Ipad where local inteactions at CLI level is difficult/impossible at present. 
However one thing I need to realise is I donot have to work in that fashion and those devises are primarily consumption devises. 
however in a situation where I would like to have some AI enhanced thought process to happen and I only have the phone I can do that now remotely on the macmini which will sync across


additionally the server helps to access files, media VNC SSH for other services and can use for experimenting with n8n etc if i wish to do so. 


I got the idea of creating a reputation about the AI and medical education person. to this end I have done some work already. 

![[01 - Fleeting Notes/Untitled 6.base]]

building upon this I can leverage NHREF and develop a course for medical education [[Objectives of my course of life design]] or [[Life design course for medical students]] or [[learning and practicing medicine when AI is in the equation - my Ai course for medical students and professionals]]


and thought of writing about [[Future-proof Learning]]


Update. 

its clear that It would be best to work on a redundant server first and then sync it to real thing AWS 

on another front managed to create a jellyfin server and use it as a media server
