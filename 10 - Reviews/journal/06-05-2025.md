# Thoughts



Wonderful day with the Parotidectomy 
I was having my doubts about the suitability of today’s patient for surgery as an individual.
There were so many insecurities and wiories and anxieties it made me feel worried,
What if something untoward pops up?
Then I realized the difficulty or the mental strain is a necessary sacrifice I needed to make for my ultimate goal achievement 
So I have chosen this game as an opportunity to develop my mind and an opportunity for achieving great merits!
