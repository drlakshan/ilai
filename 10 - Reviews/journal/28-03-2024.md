# Thoughts


I have not been very active on the academic front these days. Nonetheless I was very active on character building and thinking of a great plan. I think panchbala enhancement is the best way forward for me. That will be my life's mission. When I enhance those, I can further use artificial intelligence skills to augment my human intelligence. With the combination of these I will work on the most important thing of life. 

Next 72 hours I am on an accelerated sprint. Let’s what we can achieve. 

Just inspired to listen to Dr Romila story about creating a storybook with the hand pictures and the poems, etc., and addressing that to the first lady of China and sending it through the the  Chinese embassy and at  to get a positive response  to her plea.
