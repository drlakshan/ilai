I feel very energetic with the two excellent surgeries on the venerable monks' one is a myringoplasty on nissarana aranya senasana wasee himi and the other on the chief monk of vadasiti kanda (a parotid ) after wonderfully completing the cases, I feel energetic and apararently both Monks have given profuse blessings.

I sat for google generative ai leader exam yesterday and I passed. there are quite a number of stories to tell about it but let me just say for the moment that it was a happy and a frightening experience at the same time.
