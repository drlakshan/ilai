# Thoughts


After a little while I got the opportunity to jot down my thoughts. I want to use whatever the tech I have to improve my self and iPad is no exception, I think I am no where near what I can achieve with this, 

Let me wish all the best to myself and start using this to create the best version of myself. With slightly improved health I am able to carry the weight of this gadget when I want to think on paper and I will 

If I look back over the last week I have achieved quite a significant improvement in my mental strength. I withstood patient turmoils and failures with grace of a stoic. At the end of the day my incessant desire to achieve mental resilience on chiththan rakketha medhavi is the underlying target and Karaneeya meta sutra is helping me achieve this.
