# Thoughts


time is flying, I am building up, but I have issues, right posterior neck muscles, arm muscles being poor. some buring sensations, stocks and gloves feeling fleetingly troubling. But I am not going to give up. I was thrilled to meet Dr Amitha Fernando who was really appreciative of my decision making ability. 

Now I need to focus on ENT learning and how to apply Ai knowledge I gathered.
One tool I am going to invest is Msty. [[what I hope to get from Msty]]

Additionally I need to be intentional about ENT CPD
