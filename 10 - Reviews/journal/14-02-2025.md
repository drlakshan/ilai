# Thoughts



cervical relaxation has begun. over the next 22 day a new version of me a Human 3.0 will emerge. (daniel meisler). Will utilise years of wisdom and experience to achieve the perfect simple life I always wanted.
Triple Intelligence , Supreme Intelligence of Lord Buddha, Whatever the Human Intelligence I have and Artificial Intelligence will be aligned in a meaningful way. 
I am vey happy how I worked until the very end my tissues allowed me to. I could not proceed beyond that. I was working and being helpful until the last moment possible. 
I will have to create a nice game plan and make this time really fruitful

so far what I have learnt [[things I learnt during cervical relaxation]]

I had to go to Nawaloka as there was a post operative patient : they have not communicated well. so had to come. I made up for that by attending to car cleaning and further learning here. until 2:30 I do not have any other commitments. Got fused when HNB head office guy could not solve the mortgage release sorted . I spoke to Subramanium hopefully they should settle. Otherwise also ok. cant be bothered. what I need to do now is to somehow calm down. one pain point is when I am not here why and how the patients riot and behave. so if there a change in my schedule I need to do that well ahead. Although i can not do that for sickness.
