# Thoughts


From today my work will become by play. Or my pinkama. The perspective will change. 

PM : Came to Marino Mall. Waiting for Nan. For Sudu Chooti. It will take about 25 minutes. So planning to wait in the tea lounge with nice cup of tea. with the sea breeze soothing my body. I enjoy this very much.

Important thing I need to make note of is the serenity I achieved with the sathi nimiththa. As discussed previously this is an important realisation. Sathipattanaya is practiced to develop Sathi Nimiththa. When that is really well developed, life's problem handling becomes so much is easier. I experienced that firs hand when I had to deal with the difficult thyroid and post tonsillectomy bleed patients. I was able to deliver my best because of the serenity that i have achieved.
