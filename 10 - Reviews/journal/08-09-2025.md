# Thoughts


it has become a recurrent thought where I think of text chunk based interactions with my own accrued knowledge base (obsidian vault) and external world. Additionally I firmly believe at the end of the interaction there should be some form of note making for future you to refer back. even this very own note is something like that. I will read this somewhere in the future and will try to work out my thought process on this. 
after watching Daniel Meisters video on a similar context i feel the following:

1. all the thinking to happen within a code editor
2. all the interactions with AI to happen with in a CLI coding agent which will intelliegently call subagents when necessary
3. keep it simple and mark down


so if I have all my knowledge work experiments in a nice file structure and then interact with content of the files intentionally wouldn't that be great?
