Thoughts:


With two important realisations I am sailing through life;
1. Sathi Nimiththa and working with that focussed
2. trying not to live life on other's script : podcasts by Rasika Jayakody prompted this situation


Another important thing I am considering is that minimise stuff and work in my life and align them with the life's purpose.

Now that I have achieved some solid economic foundation, that is hopefully unshakable, now I can work on fluid liquid assets and life a freer life
