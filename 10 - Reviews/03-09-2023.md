Thoughts:

I am refining my PMS. I think with the new methodologies I would be more efficient. I found a bug that I need correcting
The problem is this when i paste values of the prescription on to the clinic book some cells a left blank. I dont know why. Tried changing the formating etc nothing seem to work. one solution I am trying to do is to redo the clinic book all over again. But that will not prevent issues with working with the old ones.
