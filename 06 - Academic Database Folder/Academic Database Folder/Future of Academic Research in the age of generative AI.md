Things Learnt:

It was a fantastic forum. Very informal and welcoming discussion on AI on research and education. After short discussion / demonstration on AI research findings using Elicit and scispace I realised that I could give more value to them by demonstrating what I can do. I showed them Research Rabbit, Obsidian, and shared my opinions in the following manner

1. fixit [[FIXIT strategy for interaction with LLMs]]
2. concept of AI as your intern
3. trust and empathy two most important skills for a doctor
4. human interaction component of education
5. encourage to go for a boot camp
6. training kids to use AI
