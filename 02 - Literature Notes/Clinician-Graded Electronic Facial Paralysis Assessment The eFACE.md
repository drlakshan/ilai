## Summary of Findings

The study introduced the **eFACE** as a comprehensive, electronic, clinician-graded scale to address the challenge of objectively assessing facial paralysis.

### Structure
The tool consists of 16 items in a visual analogue scale format to evaluate facial function, symmetry, and synkinesis.

### Methodology
The scale was validated by applying it to video recordings of patients performing facial expressions. A key finding was that dynamic parameters were weighted twice as heavily as static and synkinesis parameters when correlating with expert-rated global facial disfigurement.

### Reliability
The eFACE demonstrated high interrater (between different clinicians) and intrarater (for the same clinician at different times) reliability.

### Conclusion
The eFACE is a reliable, reproducible, and user-friendly digital tool for assessing facial function and disfigurement. It is designed for use on various electronic devices, including smartphones and tablets.
