Here are the concepts and questions related to transsphenoidal surgery found in the sources:

1. Context and Indication
• Transsphenoidal cyst drainage and biopsy of the wall are required for Rathke pouch cysts [1].
• The sphenoid sinus is highlighted as having a connection to the skull base structures, including the internal carotid artery and optic nerve, which are at risk during surgery of the sphenoid [2-4].
• Historically, open approaches to the sphenoid sinus were used by neurosurgeons in pituitary surgery [5].

2. Surgical Approaches Mentioned
The term "transsphenoidal surgery" generally refers to an approach through the sphenoid sinus. The sources mention specific related approaches:
• Open Approaches to Sphenoid Sinus: These historically used approaches involve accessing the sphenoid sinus via the septum. They include the Transseptal approach, which can utilize endonasal, sublabial, or transcolumellar incisions [5].
• Endoscopic Endonasal Approach (EEA): This modern technique often involves a sphenoidotomy [6]. The general principles of endoscopy include accessing lesions via this route if feasible [7].
• Transnasal Approaches: These approaches provide the widest access for lesions with extension medial to the carotid [8].

3. Anatomical Concerns During Transsphenoidal/Sphenoid Surgery
Surgical intervention in the sphenoid sinus carries risks due to surrounding critical anatomy:
• Vidian Nerve and Cranial Nerve V (Trigeminal): The Maxillary division of CN V (V2) and the vidian nerve may make reliefs (indentations) in the sphenoid sinus cavity [2]. The potential for pterygoid (vidian) canal injury increases with extensive lateral pneumatization of the sphenoid [9].
• Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) and Optic Nerve: These critical structures are mentioned as being near or making indentations into the sinus wall [2].
    ◦ ICA prominence and potential dehiscence of the sinus wall increase the risk of injury with disastrous results [4].
    ◦ Optic nerve injury is a risk, especially when the anterior clinoid process is pneumatized, or if sphenoethmoidal cells are present, which limit visualization [10, 11].
    ◦ The optic nerve canal and its potential dehiscence should be identified on preoperative imaging [4].
• Sphenoethmoidal (Onodi) Cells: If these posterior ethmoid cells are present and unrecognized, they increase the risk of anterior skull base penetration or undertreatment, and they may expose the optic nerve and carotid artery to risk [11-13].
• Radiation Planning: The radiation dose limit for the pituitary and hypothalamus is set at <40 Gy [14].

4. Comparison to Other Skull Base Approaches
The sources mention other skull base approaches often used for tumors in proximity to the sphenoid sinus or skull base, such as:
• Craniofacial resection: A major approach to skull base pathology, typically malignancy, which often involves bifrontal craniotomy [15, 16].
• Endoscopic Endonasal Approach (EEA): While traditionally for low-stage disease, advances allow for resection of higher-stage disease with similar survival rates, offering a less invasive alternative compared to open craniofacial resection [14].
