# Tracheotomy / Tracheostomy

## Key Points
- Became routine late 19th/early 20th century
- Decreases laryngeal trauma risk
- Promotes earlier oral feeding/communication
- **Early tracheotomy (<10 days) benefits:**
  - Reduced sedation duration
  - Reduced ICU length of stay
  - Reduced long-term mortality (ventilated patients)
  - No decrease in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
- Tube selection depends on anatomy & ventilatory needs
- Multidisciplinary teams/protocols decrease morbidity

## [[Indications for Tracheotomy]] (Box 7.1)
- **Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation**
  - Respiratory disease
  - Neuromuscular disease
  - Depressed mental status (airway protection failure)
- **Pulmonary Toilet (secretion management)**
- **Surgical Access**
  - Head and neck cancer reconstruction
  - Extensive maxillofacial fractures
- **Airway Obstruction (Relief of)**
  - Epiglottitis/supraglottitis
  - Craniofacial abnormalities
  - Tumor
  - Bilateral vocal cord paralysis
  - Angioedema
  - Foreign body
  - Blunt/penetrating neck trauma

## History of Tracheotomy
- Earliest accounts: Egyptian tablets (3600 BCE)
- Greek/Roman Era: Accounts of airway opening
- Hippocrates opposed (risk to carotid)
- Antyllus of Rome (340 CE): First firsthand surgical account
- Renaissance: Revived by anatomists/physicians
- Vesalius (1543): Ventilation on pig
- Brassavola (1546): First successful documented procedure
- George Washington (1799): Died after refusing procedure
- Mid-19th Century: Diphtheria outbreaks → Bretonneau/Trousseau advocacy
- Trendelenburg (1871): Used for general anesthesia
- Chevalier Jackson: Standardized technique/protocols
- 20th Century: Decline due to endotracheal intubation (WW1)
- Polio epidemic: Airway protection + positive pressure ventilation
- Current era: Prolonged mechanical ventilation = leading indication

## Timing of Tracheotomy
### Advantages over Intubation
- Reduced laryngeal damage/stenosis risk
- Increased patient comfort (↓ sedation)
- Potential for early oral nutrition/communication

### Consensus & Debate
- Pre-1989 consensus: Perform if ventilation > 21 days
- Ongoing debate: Early vs Late timing

### Studies by Population
- **Critical Care/ICU (TracMan Trial):**
  - Early (1–4 days) vs Late (>10 days)
  - No ICU/hospital/pneumonia difference
  - Early = 2.6 days less sedation
- **Systematic Review (Hosokawa 2015):**
  - Early (<10 days): More ventilator-free days, shorter ICU stay, ↓ sedation, ↓ long-term mortality
  - No VAP difference
- **Trauma Patients:**
  - No survival benefit early (3–8 days)
  - Trend toward less ICU/vent use in severe brain injury
- **Stroke Patients (SETPOINT):**
  - Early (3 days) vs Standard (7–14 days)
  - No ICU LOS difference
  - Early = lower sedative/narcotic use
- **Cardiothoracic Patients:**
  - Concerns: Sternal wound infection
  - One study: Early (<10 days) ↓ mortality + ICU stay
  - Conflicting data: Sternal wound infection prediction

## Operative Technique
### Open Tracheotomy
- Definition: Opening in anterior tracheal wall
- Tracheostomy: Permanent stoma with suturing
- Bedside ICU option
- **Steps (Box 7.2):**
  1. Pre-op antibiotics
  2. Neck extension (if not contraindicated)
  3. Identify cartilage landmarks (hyoid, thyroid, cricoid)
  4. Incision: Vertical (urgent) / Horizontal (2nd ring)
  5. Divide skin, subcutaneous tissue, strap muscles
  6. Mobilize/divide thyroid isthmus
  7. Secure airway with cricoid hook
  8. Enter airway (rings 2–3 or 3–4)
  9. Preferred: Horizontal incision + Björk flap
  10. Retract ETT above opening
  11. Insert tracheostomy tube, confirm ventilation
  12. Secure tube (suture + ties)

### Percutaneous Tracheotomy (PDT)
- **Benefits:**
  - Faster (9.8–25.7 min faster)
  - ↓ transport burden/risk for critically ill
  - Cost savings (~$400/procedure)
- **Techniques:**
  - Seldinger (1969)
  - Dilational (Ciaglia 1985)
  - Ciaglia Blue Rhino (single tapered dilator)
  - Griggs guidewire forceps
  - Fantoni translaryngeal (retrograde)
  - PercuTwist (screw-like dilator)
- **Contraindications/Considerations:**
  - Not in children (mobile/collapsible trachea)
  - Open preferred in: neck masses, coagulation issues, FiO2 >70%, C-spine injury
  - Obesity (BMI >30): ↑ complication risk (decannulation)
- **Bronchoscopic Assistance:**
  - Reduces complications
  - Protects posterior membranous wall

## Tracheostomy Tubes
- **History:** Jackson → modern double-lumen metal tube
- **Selection factors:** Lung mechanics, anatomy, communication
- **Materials:**
  - Metal: Low profile, no cuff/vent connector
  - Plastic: Variable, cuffed/uncuffed, ventilator compatible
- **Configuration:**
  - Inner diameter (ID): airflow/work of breathing
  - Outer diameter (OD)
  - Length
  - Curvature
- **Types:**
  - Extra proximal (horizontal): Obese neck/posterior trachea
  - Extra distal (vertical): Bypass stenosis/malacia
  - Adjustable/custom
- **Cuff:**
  - Uncuffed: No ventilation, for obstruction bypass, suctioning, speech
  - Cuffed: Enables positive pressure ventilation
  - High-volume/low-pressure: Reduces stenosis risk (<25–30 mm Hg)
  - Low-volume/high-pressure (TTS): For intermittent PPV, easier speech


## Tracheostomy Care
- Multidisciplinary care improves outcomes
- Goals: ↓ morbidity, earlier decannulation, ↑ quality of life
- AAO-HNS consensus statement (2011) standardizes care
