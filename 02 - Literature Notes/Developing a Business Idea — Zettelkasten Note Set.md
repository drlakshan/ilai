## **1. Foundation — Understanding Yourself and Context**

```markdown

category: business development
aliases:
  - self audit for founders

---

**Core Idea:**  
Every strong business idea begins with self-knowledge. Clarify purpose, resources, and risk tolerance before you brainstorm.

**Checklist:**
1. Write a *Founder Intent Statement* — why you’re building this.
2. Audit skills (technical, market, leadership).  
3. Define financial and emotional runway (≈ 1 year living lean).  
4. Note acceptable risk limits — failure comfort zone.

## **2. Idea Generation Framework**

```markdown
---
category: innovation
aliases:
  - brainstorming business ideas
source:

  - Y Combinator How to Get and Evaluate Startup Ideas
---

**Approach:**
1. Start with **personal frustrations** → high empathy & insight.  
2. Observe others’ pain points (interviews, forums, communities).  
3. Track **daily or weekly problems** (frequent = viable).  
4. Scan trends & niches where billions are already spent.  
5. Capture 10+ ideas in a [[Problem Bank]] note.

**Tool:**  
Use YC’s one-line format: *“I’m building X to help Y do Z.”*

## **3. Idea Evaluation and Validation**

```markdown
---
category: market research
aliases:
  - testing startup ideas
source:
  - Y Combinator Startup School
  - Small Business Advice Channel
---

**Key Questions:**
1. **Market Size** — who pays, how often, and how much?  
2. **Competitors** — what works, what fails, what’s missing?  
3. **Problem–Solution Fit** — is the pain urgent & recurring?  
4. **User Interviews** — 5–10 target users: note emotional responses.

**Validation Metric:**  
Evidence of *behavioral commitment* (sign-ups, payments, repeated use) beats verbal praise.

```markdown
---
category: product development
aliases:
  - minimum viable product
  - rapid prototype strategy
source:
  - Y Combinator Startup School

**Principles:**
- Launch within **two months** — perfection delays learning.  
- Start small: manual service → no-code → automated tool.  
- Observe **real user behavior**.  
- Weekly iteration loop: ship → measure → learn → repeat.

**Metrics:**
- Retention Rate  
- Referrals / Shares  
- Activation Events

## **6. Growth and Momentum**

category: scaling
aliases:
  - startup growth loop
  - traction strategy
source:
  - Y Combinator Startup School
  - Crash Course Business Entrepreneurship #2
---

**Growth Channels:**
- **B2B:** reference customers — delight few, let word spread.  
- **B2C:** bake sharing into usage.  
- **Press DIY:** warm intros to journalists; pitch real news.  

**Rule:** Growth solves every problem.  
Investors chase momentum, not pitches.

## **7. Reflection and Sustainability**

```markdown

**Habits:**
- Monthly retrospective: what worked, what didn’t.  
- Update Zettels like [[Idea Validation Log]] and [[Metrics Tracker]].  
- Maintain founder wellness — balance solitude & connection.  
- Reinvest lessons into the next build cycle.

**Quote:**  
“Silence is where conviction grows; reflection is where it endures.”
