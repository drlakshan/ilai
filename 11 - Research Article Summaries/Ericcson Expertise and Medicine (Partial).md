“When people and professionals are first introduced to an activity, their primary goal is to reach a sufficient level of mastery that is acceptable to other people in the domain. According to the traditional theory of skill acquisition,2 people need initially to concentrate on what they are going to do in order to reduce gross mistakes, as illustrated in the lower arm of Figure 3.” ([Ericsson, 2004, p. 73](zotero://select/library/items/EHMX6UCY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDC5U8P4?page=4&annotation=AUJ3JTXP))

“The key challenge for aspiring expert performers is to avoid the arrested development associated with automaticity and to acquire cognitive skills to support their continued learning and improvement. The expert performer counteracts the tendencies toward automaticity by actively acquiring and refining cognitive mechanisms to support continued learning and improvement, as shown in the upper arm of Figure 3.” ([Ericsson, 2004, p. 73](zotero://select/library/items/EHMX6UCY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDC5U8P4?page=4&annotation=KNSMESBL))

“Deliberate practice is therefore designed to improve specific aspects of performance in a manner that assures that attained changes can be successfully integrated into representative performance. Hence, practice aimed at improving integrated performance cannot be performed mindlessly or independent of the representative context for the target performance. More accomplished individuals in the domain, ideally professional coaches and teachers, will play an essential role in guiding the future experts to acquire superior performance in a safe and effective manner.” ([Ericsson, 2004, p. 74](zotero://select/library/items/EHMX6UCY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDC5U8P4?page=5&annotation=V8FLFVU2))

“These mechanisms are not the result of mere experience. Rather, their development requires engagement in deliberate practice that gradually builds complex integrated systems of representations for the execution, monitoring, planning, and evaluation of actions” ([Ericsson, 2004, p. 74](zotero://select/library/items/EHMX6UCY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDC5U8P4?page=5&annotation=UFC5EA5K))
