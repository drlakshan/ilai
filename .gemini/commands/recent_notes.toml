Synthesize the notes created or modified in the last {{argument}}.

1.  First, identify the files. Use the `run_shell_command` with `find` to locate all markdown files in the vault (`/Users/drlakshan/Desktop/Obsidian-AWS/`) that were modified within the timeframe of `{{argument}}`. You'll need to parse the duration string (e.g., '7 days' -> '-mtime -7', '3 weeks' -> '-mtime -21', '1 month' -> '-mtime -30').

2.  Once you have the list of file paths, use the `read_many_files` tool to get their content.

3.  Finally, synthesize the content. Identify the main themes, key insights, and any action items or questions raised in the notes. Present this as a concise summary.
