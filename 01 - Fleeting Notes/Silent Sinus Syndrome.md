# Note

when osteomeatal complex is obstructed 
a negative pressure is created inside
uncinate is extremely lateralised
so is the orbital floor
maxillary sinus is full

What is Silent Sinus Syndrome?
?
painless facial asymmetry secondary to imploding maxillary sinus presumed to be due to negative pressure of the maxillary sinus secondary to OMC obstruction characterised by enopthalmos and hypoglobus

“The etiology of silent sinus syndrome (SSS) is unclear. SSS is associated with obstruction of the OMC. The resultant negative pressure is presumed to cause a gradual implosion of the maxillary cavity, resulting in a very small and contracted maxillary sinus. The uncinate process is lateralized toward the maxillary sinus, getting plastered to the medial orbital wall. The roof of the sinus, which is the orbital floor, may also be “sucked” toward the maxillary sinus and may cause enophthalmos. Mucus and secretions collect within the sinus, and a simple uncinectomy and maxillary antrostomy are effective for treating this condition and for preventing further enophthalmos. Great care is necessary when removing the uncinate process plastered against the orbit to avoid orbital injury.61” ([Lal, p. 688](zotero://select/library/items/46FHZW8Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2CQ9ZPN3?page=13&annotation=B6G6WGWQ))

## Summary of the Abstract on Silent Sinus Syndrome

- **Patient Presentation**: The paper discusses a case involving a 32-year-old male who visited an otolaryngology outpatient department due to noticeable facial misalignment over three weeks. He reported a sunken left eye and asymmetrical maxillary bone protrusion, but had no recent facial trauma or nasal symptoms **[**1**]**.
    
- **Physical Examination Findings**: Upon examination, the patient exhibited a deepening of the left superior orbital sulcus and left hypoglobus. His visual acuity and eye movements were normal, and nasal endoscopy showed no signs of polyps or inflammation **[**1**]**.
    
- **Diagnostic Imaging**: A CT scan revealed inward bowing of the left maxillary sinus walls, leading to reduced sinus volume and downward displacement of the orbital floor. This imaging was crucial for diagnosing Silent Sinus Syndrome (SSS) **[**1**]**.
    
- **Surgical Intervention**: The patient underwent endoscopic maxillary antrostomy, where total occlusion of the maxillary sinus ostium and mucus accumulation were found. The surgery aimed to restore patency to the maxillary sinus **[**1**]**.
    
- **Postoperative Outcomes**: Six months post-surgery, the patient reported improved facial symmetry, and follow-up CT scans showed significant expansion of the maxillary sinus and improvement in enophthalmos (sunken eye appearance) **[**1**]**.
    
- **Diagnosis Criteria**: The criteria for diagnosing SSS include spontaneous enophthalmos or hypoglobus, maxillary sinus contraction with OMC occlusion on CT, and absence of sinonasal inflammatory disease or trauma **[**1**]**.
    
- **Pathophysiology**: The paper explains that SSS results from maxillary sinus hypoventilation due to OMC occlusion, leading to gas resorption and negative pressure, which causes sinus wall retraction and bone demineralization over time **[**1**]**.
    
- **Surgical Trends**: The paper notes a shift from traditional surgical methods to endoscopic techniques, which have benefits like lower infection rates and reduced risk of complications. It discusses the debate over whether to perform orbital floor reconstruction during maxillary surgery **[**1**]**.
    
- **Conclusion**: The case highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and treatment for aesthetic concerns related to SSS, with the patient achieving satisfactory cosmetic results from the procedure **[**1**]**.
