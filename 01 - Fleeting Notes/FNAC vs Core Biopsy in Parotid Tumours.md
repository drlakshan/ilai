# Core Needle Biopsy vs Fine Needle Aspiration

Comparison of tissue sampling techniques for parotid masses.

## Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA)
- Thin needle aspiration for cytological exam
- Highly accurate for benign vs malignant distinction
- Small false-negative rate (4-8%)
- Limited architectural detail

## Core Needle Biopsy (CNB)
- 16-18 gauge needle for tissue core
- Preserves architectural detail
- Superior histological diagnosis capability
- Better tumor subtyping ability
- Higher sensitivity than FNA

## Clinical Application
- CNB preferred for complex cases or non-diagnostic FNA
- FNA suitable for initial screening
