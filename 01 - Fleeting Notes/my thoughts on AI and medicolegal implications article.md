Title: Medicolegal Aspects of the Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare: Challenges, Current Regulations, and Future Directions

1. The ultimate responsibility for patient care rests with the treating clinician. This principle remains true in the AI era, just as it was in the pre-AI era when clinicians used various technologies (e.g., textbooks, IT solutions) to inform their decisions. Even though clinicians did not verify every piece of information, the onus of patient care remained theirs. Similarly, the concept remains in the AI age. While AI holds immense promise, its implementation must be guided by strong ethical principles to avoid legal and moral pitfalls. The key is to keep humans, especially medical professionals, "in the loop" as the key stakeholders and decision-makers, using AI as an assistive tool rather than a replacement. Just as a clinician is responsible for applying knowledge from a textbook correctly, they are responsible for critically evaluating and applying an AI's output.
    
2. Similarly, guidelines developed with human input can serve as source material for AI-powered clinical decision support systems, much like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that are grounded in established sources.
    
3. To prevent a reduction in the cognitive ability of healthcare delivery teams, and thus prevent a threat to patient well-being, cognitive development should be a core consideration in AI interactions. Medical education must include AI-specific training to enhance the knowledge of healthcare professionals, enabling them to judiciously use AI systems.  
      
    A few suggestions:
    

4. Create a Dedicated Subsection: Consider creating a dedicated subsection within "Overreliance on AI in Clinical Decision-Making" 15 titled "Cognitive Deskilling and the Imperative for a New Educational Paradigm."
    
5. Expand on the Threat: This is more than just a future concern; it's a present threat to patient well-being. Over-reliance erodes the critical thinking and intuitive diagnostic skills built over years of practice. When the AI is wrong, or when it is unavailable, a deskilled clinician poses a significant risk.
    
6. Reframing AI Education: The "Future Directions" section correctly calls for integrating AI literacy into medical education. This section could be strengthened by framing this not just as technical training, but as cognitive resilience training. Medical education must teach students how to disagree with an algorithm, how to spot its biases, and when to override its recommendations. This is a core competency for the AI era.
    

7. The integration of AI systems will involve both system-level and individual-level aspects, necessitating clear definitions of responsibility at various levels within these hybrid systems.  
      
    A suggestion: Define the Levels: Explain that liability is not just a legal question for courts but an organizational challenge.
    

8. System-Level Responsibility: This falls on the hospital or institution. It includes the duty to procure validated, ethical AI tools; to ensure seamless and safe integration with EMRs; to monitor AI performance post-deployment; and to establish clear protocols for when and how AI should be used.
    
9. Individual-Level Responsibility: This remains with the clinician. It is the duty to use the tool as trained, to understand its limitations, to apply critical judgment, to document its use and their rationale, and ultimately, to make the final patient-care decision.
    

10. Continuous evaluations by independent bodies, comprising clinicians, technologists, and the public (stakeholders), are essential. These evaluations should function as a "living document."
    
11. Recommendations and regulations should be tailored to the unique healthcare delivery systems of each country considering the resources, cultural norms, and unique features of that particular healthcare system.
