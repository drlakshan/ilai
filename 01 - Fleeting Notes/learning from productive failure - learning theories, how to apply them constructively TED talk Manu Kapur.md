the concept of productive failure goes like this
design the learning activity so that there is no clear answer to solve and after failure teach the concept then the retention is better

he (Manu Kapur) talks of three issues of learning
many other concepts were discussed
1. perception as the first thing that happens in learing, followed by understanding (giving the context or the prior knowledge, and transfer of skills; these are the three things we need to solve in education)
2. To achieve this he proposes productive failure. 
3. [[Vygotsky's zone of proximal development]] 
4. idea generation etc
