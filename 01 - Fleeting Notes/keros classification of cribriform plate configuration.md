The Keros classification is widely used to evaluate the nasal roof depth [[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8935634/#REF4)]. As stated in the Keros classification, the depth of the olfactory fossa is estimated in three categories: type 1 (1-3 mm), type 2 (4-7 mm), and type 3 (8-16 mm) [[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8935634/#REF12)]. Type 3 is the most dangerous and important type of endoscopic sinus surgery and has a very thin cribriform plate [[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8935634/#REF13)]. The imbalance of the depth of both sides’ olfactory fossa or the height of the ethmoidal roof may lead to a greater risk of intracranial infiltration during endoscopic sinus surgery [[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8935634/#REF3),[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8935634/#REF14)].
