“Zinc sulfate Among the most widely cited and controversial treatments for chemosensory disorders in medical literature is oral zinc sulfate (ZnSO4). Although most studies have focused on taste, claims have been made that ZnSO4 also improves smell dysfunction (Henkin et al., 1975). However, in a double-blind study, 106 patients with chemosensory dysfunction were crossed over between placebo and ZnSO4 and no statistically significant effects of zinc on either taste or smell function were found (Henkin et al., 1976). More recent double-blindstudies have similarly failed to demonstrate zinc as an effective therapy for general smell or taste problems (Lyckholm et al., 2012) or age-related taste deficits (Greger and Geissler, 1978). A large-scale clinical study of patients with chemosensory dysfunction revealed no differences in taste or smell scores between patients taking or not taking zinc supplements (Deems et al., 1991). It is important to point out that at dosages often prescribed for chemosensory dysfunction, such side effects as iron deficiency anemia, copper deficiency, gastric distress, neutropenia, and impaired immune function can occur in some patients (Fosmire, 1990).” ([Doty, 2019, p. 467](zotero://select/library/items/3CKL5XD7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GZX9AHXQ?page=13&annotation=5I96PVEY))
