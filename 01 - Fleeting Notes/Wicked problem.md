A problem which is so complicated with ever changing variables 


# Reference

wicked problems are difficult to solve because of incomplete or contradictory information or changing requirements. There may also be a large number of stakeholders and opinions involved, and the problems are often closely connected with other problems. Wicked problems by definition have multiple causes and lack a single “right” answer. Terrorism, poverty, and global warming are all examples of wicked problems.
