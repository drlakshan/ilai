### Dragonfly Thinking

**Concept:** Dragonfly Thinking, developed by Anthea Roberts, is a method for analyzing complex problems by integrating diverse perspectives and disciplinary insights. It's analogous to a dragonfly's multi-lensed vision, aiming to create a holistic understanding and overcome the limitations of siloed expertise.

**Application:** This approach is particularly valuable for tackling multifaceted global issues where economic, political, social, and technological factors are intertwined. It encourages a shift from a single-expert view to a multi-lens analysis.
