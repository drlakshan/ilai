Example: "Evolution, as a concept, has shaped the development of species. What are the main drivers of evolution, and how has evolution affected modern humans?"

  

## 19. Use output primers by ending your prompt with the start of the anticipated response.

Example: "Describe the principle behind Newton's First Law of Motion. Explanation:"

  

## 20. Clearly state the requirements that the model must follow.

Example: "Create a packing list for a beach vacation, including the following keywords "sunscreen," "swimsuit," and "beach towel" as essential items."

## 22. Use the phrase "Write a detailed [essay/text/paragraph] for me on [topic] in detail".

Example: "Write a detailed paragraph for me on the evolution of smartphones in detail by adding all the information necessary."

  

## 23. Use the phrase "Use the same language based on the provided paragraph[/title/text /essay/answer]".

## 24. Use the phrase "Try to revise every paragraph sent by users".

Example: "Try to revise every text sent by users. You should only improve the user's grammar and vocabulary and make sure it sounds natural.
