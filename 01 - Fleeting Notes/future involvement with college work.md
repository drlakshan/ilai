One of the reasons that I don't want to get involved is that I was not given membership of the council. I felt that I was not given the due recognition. It may be because that I didn't accept the scientific secretary post. However, I clearly mentioned to the president elect that I would like to be part of the council giving my opinions and representing the private sector. The question is was there a place in the general council sans a named post. If there had been and I was denied Its justifiable that I feel betrayed if not I don't know. 

I would like to develop my own academic work. I have the ways and means. All should start with a why. Why do you want to get involved in academic work? At the end of the day it is to benefit the patient in front of you. I am getting disillusioned with all these professional body involvement by the day. I will create my own educational videos should I really want to teach some one. Or just study for my own satisfaction and show the work or may be involved in the undergraduate education. Or I will create teaching opportunities that wont undermine myself. With the help of the skill set I have I am in a position to rise to a greater height. 

When imparting this knowledge to others I will exert due diligance. Lets concentrate on what is under my control and ignore the rest. [[Stoicism dichotomy of control]]
