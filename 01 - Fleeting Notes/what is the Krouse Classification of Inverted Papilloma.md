“Krouse Staging System for Inverted Papilloma T1 Tumor totally confined to the nasal cavity, without extension into the sinuses. The tumor can be localized to one wall or region of the nasal cavity, or can be bulky and extensive within the nasal cavity, but must not extend into the sinuses or into any extra nasal compartment.

There must be no concurrent malignancy T3 Tumor involving the lateral, inferior, superior, anterior, or posterior walls of the maxillary sinus, the sphenoid sinus, and/or the frontal sinus, with or without involvement of the medial portion of the maxillary sinus, the ethmoid sinuses, or the nasal cavity. There must be no concurrent malignancy T4 All tumors with any extra nasal/extra sinus extension to involve adjacent, contiguous structures such as the orbit, the intracranial compartment, or the pterygomaxillary space.
