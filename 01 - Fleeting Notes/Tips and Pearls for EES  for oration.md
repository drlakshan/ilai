**Enhancing Endoscopic Expertise**: Mastery in endoscopic ear surgery hinges on advanced technical proficiency. It demands adeptness in endoscope manipulation, effective use of angled instruments, and a consistent clear view during surgery.

**Strategic Patient Selection**: Success in endoscopic ear surgery significantly depends on choosing appropriate patients. Ideal candidates typically present with small to medium-sized perforations, cholesteatoma, or issues in the ossicular chain.

**Optimal Patient Positioning**: Achieving an unobstructed view and access to ear structures necessitates precise patient positioning. Ensure the patient's head is correctly aligned and stable throughout the procedure.

**Critical Illumination Techniques**: Exceptional illumination is vital. Position the endoscope to illuminate the surgical area effectively, enhancing visibility.

**Employment of Angled Instruments**: Angled instruments are essential for improved access and minimising tissue damage at the surgical site.

**Anatomical Mastery**: A thorough understanding of ear anatomy is imperative. Recognize the three-dimensional structure of the ear and anticipate potential surgical complications.

**Patience and Precision**: Approach endoscopic ear surgery with patience. Careful tissue dissection and manipulation are key to successful outcomes.

**Commitment to Ongoing Education**: Continuously update your skills and knowledge. Participate in workshops, conferences, and courses focusing on the latest techniques and developments in endoscopic ear surgery.

**Meticulous Attention to Detail**: Pay close attention to surgical preparation and ensure all necessary tools are at hand before beginning.

**Teamwork in Surgery**: Endoscopic ear surgery is a collaborative effort. Work closely with anesthesiologists, nurses, and other team members for optimal patient results.

**Additional Surgical Insights**:

   1. Perform infiltration prior to scrubbing.
   2. Use sutures to straighten the canal wall.
   3. Trim ear canal hair.
   4. Employ warm saline irrigation.
   5. Utilize netcel pieces.
   6. Block the Eustachian tube opening when necessary.
   7. While holders can facilitate two-handed operation, they pose a risk of damage to the ear's delicate structures, especially if the patient moves unexpectedly.
   8. Maintain the light source at less than 50% power to prevent thermal injury.

“INTRODUCING ENDOSCOPIC EAR SURGERY INTO PRACTICE After taking an EES course, the authors recommend a 3-step process to introduce EES into your operative routine: 1. Use the endoscope during chronic ear surgery after the microscope-based dissection to Look for hidden disease Perform a complete 360 endoscopic survey of the middle ear cleft with a 30 endoscope Assess the ossicular chain and round window 2. Perform a “basic” transcanal procedure, including Endoscopic examination under anesthesia of the external canal and tympanic membrane before your microscopic dissection to document pathology Cerumen removal Tympanostomy tube placement Myringoplasty (without drum elevation) 3. Use the microscope to begin raising the tympanomeatal flap, then complete elevation with EES techniques Switch to a 0 endoscope before dissection of the annulus and then complete your tympanotomy endoscopically At the onset, do not expect to be able to perform a case from beginning to end using an endoscope. Use the endoscope for limited aspects of cases. As you gain proficiency, do less with the microscope and more with the endoscope. Indeed, do not be concerned if you need to transition to a microscopic case, which is very common when starting EES and is encouraged. After fluency in basic EES techniques is achieved, you may begin to consider more advanced instrumentation, such as curved suctions (Fig. 7). Pearls and Pitfalls The following are some pearls and pitfalls for new endoscopic ear surgeons: Proper trimming of ear hair is critical before the start of EES. The endoscope will likely be placed into the ear canal many times during a routine case. Hair will smudge the lens, and the endoscope will require constant wiping. The authors use curved iris scissors under endoscopic guidance to ensure atraumatic hair removal. A microwipe saturated with saline and defog pad may be placed near the head of the patient for easy access. Animal studies have indicated potential ototoxicity of defog solution, a combination of ethyl alcohol and surfactant.20 The authors advise wiping the endoscope after” ([Kozin et al., 2021, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/AJDHTCQM)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NJQ2724V?page=10&annotation=68A2HIXL))

“Avoid endoscope holders. We generally do not recommend the use of an endoscope holder.21 If the patient moves during surgery, a fixed endoscope in the external or middle ear could irreversibly damage critical structures. In addition, most ear canals are unable to easily accommodate 3 simultaneous instruments. Hemostasis is critical. Injection of a mixture of lidocaine and dilute epinephrine with a 27-gauge bent needle may assist in hemostasis when raising a tympanomeatal flap. A small cotton ball soaked in epinephrine may also be helpful to place in the ear canal near the edge of the flap. Continuous surgical count of cotton balls during surgery is crucial to avoid leaving these items in the middle ear. Also, gently elevating the upper body may result in decreased bleeding. It is also important to communicate with the anesthesiologist regarding blood pressure maintenance. Safely avoiding high blood pressure will help reduce bleeding. Keep the light source at less than 50% power. Several studies have demonstrated the potential for high temperatures in the middle ear associated with radiant energy from the endoscope.22–25 For this reason, the authors recommend keeping the power of” ([Kozin et al., 2021, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/AJDHTCQM)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NJQ2724V?page=11&annotation=9IUQCGPU))

“he light source no greater than 50% and a safe distance (>5 mm) away inner ear structures. Frequently taking the endoscope out of the middle ear, along with occasional suction and saline irrigation, is important for cooling the middle ear space. SUMMARY The experienced ear surgeon who wishes to include the intraoperative use of rigid endoscopes into his or her surgical practice may readily do so with only minimal additional equipment and setup. Essential equipment for EES includes a light source, Fig. 7. Curved suctions. The ideal suction should have a manufactured curved tip and swivel connector for tubing to reduce twisting during delicate maneuvers. Traditional otologic suctions can also be bent by the surgeon to achieve similar results; however, bending often crimps the lumen of the suction, reducing suctioning power and causing premature blockage. A wire stylet can be placed before bending but this only minimally reduces crimping. For most applications, only a minimally curved or bent suction tip is needed. A more exaggerated curved suction is difficult to manipulate and can increase the risk of injuring ossicles, facial nerve, or tympanic tegmen. (Adapted from Kozin ED, Kiringoda R, Lee DJ.

“rigid endoscopes, HD camera, and an HD video monitor, equipment already available in operating rooms where endoscopic sinus surgery is done. In order to successfully use endoscopic ear techniques, it is important to have good optics. Endoscopes gradually and insidiously degrade in optical quality and have to be replaced. Mishandling endoscopes during sterile processing may degrade the optics rapidly. High-quality camera systems and HD monitors are needed to proceed with EES in a stress-free manner. Several good ear surgeons have grown frustrated and abandoned EES solely due to limitations in optical quality of their equipment. One should not expect to be able to perform surgery from beginning to end using an endoscope while learning EES. Initially, use the endoscope for limited aspects of cases. There is no need to be concerned if one needs to transition back to a microscopic case, which is very common when starting EES. As the surgeon gains experience with EES, he or she may do less with the microscope and more with the endoscope, while gradually incorporating the use of angled instruments.” ([Kozin et al., 2021, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/AJDHTCQM)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NJQ2724V?page=12&annotation=EWVZRJ93))

“ Pearls Pitfalls Surgical tips Endoscopic ear surgery KEY POINTS Using websites, formal endoscopic courses, and developing a mentor-prote ́ ge ́ relationship with an experienced surgeon are useful tools while getting started with endoscopic ear surgery. Initially start with simple procedures such as myringotomy, tympanostomy tube insertion, endoscopic inspection of the middle ear, and raising a tympanomeatal flap. Dedicated tools such as suction round knife and up-curved and down-curved suctions are valuable for endoscopic ear surgery. Strategies to avoid and manage bleeding, prevent fogging, and familiarization with simple equipment troubleshooting are important to assure feasible, safe, and frustration-free endoscopic ear surgery.” ([Stern Shavit et al., 2021, p. 201](zotero://select/library/items/IC9NICI3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GEJPHXIN?page=1&annotation=7QWIDSCF))

“Skills Trainers and Surgical Simulators Surgical simulation has a broad range of applications in surgical training for otolaryngologists.26,27 A decrease in operative time for trainees because of institutional pressures for operative efficiency and work hour restrictions,28 combined with a scarcity of cadaver dissection courses, make for an abrupt transition from classroom to operating room. Simultaneously, recent advances in consumer technology have enabled the recreation of high-fidelity anatomic models and procedures using three-dimensional (3D) printing and virtual reality (VR). In a review of otolaryngology simulation surgery, otology was described as the most developed out of the subspecialties.26 Many of these studies involve surgical simulation exercises related to temporal bone drilling, but some focus on myringotomies and tube placements.26,27,29 EES simulators are not as widely available as those targeted at mastoidectomy or myringotomy, but a rise in interest for dedicated EES trainers over recent years is likely in response to rising popularity of EES. Simulation exercises for EES require new designs to be built from scratch. Most existing models are not repurposed easily for two main reasons: the lack of a soft tissue auricle incorporated into existing temporal bone models, and the lack of skills assessment for one-handed dissection using specialized surgical instruments. Over the last half decade, novel simulators have been designed and tested. A pilot study by Dedmon and colleagues30 described a physical task trainer with a transcanal endoscopic approach using a cadav” ([Barber, p. 69](zotero://select/library/items/RUQCDSVU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FV2MSR95?page=5&annotation=CJKHDDIU))
