I revisited this concept today 
I have written about it before
Came across it again in YT premium

So if I am an energy field, following apply

1: I am in better control of my productivity as opposed to time management where time is a resource that cannot be manipulated on will. However energy can be replenished and multiplied 

2: there are situations and times where the energy level fluctuates and hence can be wisely utilized 

3: there have to be hacks that can manipulate energy levels 

4: need to be aware of energy drains and energy boosts and can be used wisely 



5: could this be related to irdhipada Dhamma?
