# Managing Sialadenitis in Sjögren's Syndrome

## Overview
Managing acute sialadenitis associated with Sjögren's syndrome involves a multi-pronged approach that addresses both the immediate inflammation and the underlying autoimmune condition.

## I. Acute Sialadenitis Management (During a Flare-Up)

The goals during an acute flare are to reduce pain, swelling, and the risk of infection.

### Hydration
- Crucial due to reduced saliva production
- Aim for at least 8 glasses of water daily, more during flares
- Helps flush salivary ducts and thin secretions

### Sialogogues (Saliva Stimulants)
1. Over-the-counter options:
   - Sugar-free lemon drops or candies
   - Sugar-free chewing gum

2. Prescription medications:
   - Pilocarpine (Salagen)
   - Cevimeline (Evoxac)

### Physical Treatments
- **Warm Compresses**: Apply for 15-20 minutes several times daily
- **Gentle Massage**: Towards salivary duct opening (seek professional guidance)

### Pain Management
1. Over-the-counter options:
   - NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen)
   - Acetaminophen
2. Prescription pain relievers for severe cases

### Additional Treatments
- **Antibiotics**: Only if bacterial infection is present
- **Oral Hygiene**:
  - Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste
  - Daily flossing
  - Alcohol-free mouthwash
  - Regular dental checkups
- **Rest**: Essential for recovery

## II. Long-Term Management and Prevention

### Disease Management
1. Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs):
   - Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)
   - Methotrexate
   - Other immunosuppressants as needed

2. Regular monitoring:
   - Rheumatologist follow-up
   - Saliva substitutes
   - Dry eye management

### Lifestyle Modifications
1. **Diet**:
   - Avoid dry, sticky, acidic foods
   - Choose moist foods
   - Stay hydrated during meals
   - Limit alcohol and caffeine

2. **Environment**:
   - Use humidifiers
   - Avoid smoking
   - Manage stress

### Medical Procedures
- Regular dental care (every 3-6 months)
- Salivary gland imaging when needed
- Sialendoscopy in specific cases

## III. Warning Signs - Seek Immediate Care

- Fever over 101°F (38.3°C)
- Difficulty swallowing/breathing
- Rapid swelling
- Severe uncontrolled pain
- Spreading redness
- Pus drainage
- Dehydration symptoms

## Important Notes
- Treatment plans should be individualized
- Requires long-term commitment
- Consider management of other underlying conditions
- Regular consultation with healthcare team is essential
