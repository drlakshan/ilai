this is the new work on living 
how I will life the rest of my life
I have a limited stay and it is ending out very fast
so I should and I am making progress in thinking about it and how to continue working on it. 

i have been listening to concept of karma and thought long and hard on character development


Basically intentional living and creating a life worth living. 
starting from the fundamentals, i have constraints in the buddhist levels. A way I work. starting from Aryakantha Sheelaya anabissaro [[16-04-23#four principles of life]]
