 # EHDI 1-3-6 Goals Framework

  Standard of care milestones in pediatric audiology:

  • **1 month**: Universal newborn hearing screening (OAEs/AABR)
  • **3 months**: Complete diagnostic evaluation if screening failed
  • **6 months**: Early intervention enrollment with amplification

  Critical timeline for optimal language development outcomes.

  ## Clinical Significance
  - Evidence-based benchmarks for pediatric hearing loss management
  - Strongly correlated with improved long-term language outcomes
  - Foundation for all pediatric audiology protocols
