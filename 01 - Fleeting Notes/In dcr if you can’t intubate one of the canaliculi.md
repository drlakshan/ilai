You can intubate the other one and then remove the original one and introduce the other end. 


Context

There was a patient who had plating done and the upper canaliculus could be intubated but the lower one was not budging. The tube kept on getting dislodged from the attachment point of the metal introducer. 

Then Dr Makuloluwa used a new one to intubate the lower one and took off the upper one and intubate that with the other end of the lower one.
