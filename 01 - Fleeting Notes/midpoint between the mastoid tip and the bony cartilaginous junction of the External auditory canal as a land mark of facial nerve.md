In the usual way, the posterior border of the parotid is identified and dissected off the mastoid and the cartilaginous EAC. two landmarks ; mastoid tip and the bony cartilaginous junction identified. the mid point of the line connecting the two. then go anterior.

“We use modified Blair’s incision,5 that consists of a vertical preauricular limb, a curvature under the ear lobule, and a somewhat horizontal limb in a natural skin crease of the neck (Fig. 1A). Next, the flap in addition to the subcutaneous adipose tissue is raised in the plane superficial to the superficial musculo-aponeurotic system and superficial cervical fascia. It is raised at the level of subplatysmal plane until the anterior border of the gland is reached at the level of the masseter muscle. Then, the posterior aspect of the parotid gland is skeletonize and separated from the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM). Deep to the SCM muscle, the parotid gland is attached to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle; which is a key landmark in this operation. The parotid gland should be dissected from the digastric muscle completely, all the way to its origin on the mastoid tip that helps to anticipate the depth of the main trunk of the facial nerve. Anteriorly, the gland is separated from the anterior aspect of the cartilaginous part of external auditory meatus, exposing the osteocartilaginous junction of the external auditory meatus. After that, we use our technique which helps to pin point the position of the main trunk. We draw an imaginary line between mastoid tip inferiorly and bony-cartilaginous junction of the external auditory canal superiorly, which is almost 2 cm in its length. The main trunk of the facial nerve can be visualized at the midpoint of this line (Figs. 1B and 2A). After the facial nerve is identified at the trunk level, following the branches forward in the glandular parenchyma becomes easier (Fig. 2B).” ([“An Improved and Simplified Approach to Identify the Facial Nerve During Parotid Surgery.”, 2020, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/QKXHDXKF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5DI5FN6T?page=1&annotation=2R9KL8EF))
