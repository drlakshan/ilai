# What Did I learn?

1. lecture --> learn
2. lecturer ask questions to elicit answers socratic inversion (First Socratic ) Langdell 1870
3. second socratic inversion : teaching how to ask better more critical questions from AI






# Context:

 The Second Inversion of the Socratic Method
  Coined by Anthea Roberts, this is a proposed pedagogical
  model for education in the age of AI. While the first
  inversion of the Socratic method shifted the dynamic to
  teachers asking questions that students must answer, this
  second inversion argues that the student's primary task is
  now to learn how to ask better, more critical questions of
  AI systems. In this model, the crucial skill is not finding
  answers, which AI can do instantly, but critically
  reviewing, evaluating, and refining the AI-generated
  responses to co-create genuine knowledge.
