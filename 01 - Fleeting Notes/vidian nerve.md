Vidian nerve is a nerve in the skull base formed  the confluence of greater superficial petrosal branch of the facial nerve and the deep petrosal branch from the glossophrangeal nerve


So vidian nerve is a confluence of two cranial nerves FACIAL and Glossopharyngeal 
FACIAL : PARASYMPATHETIC
GLOSSOPHARYNGEAL : SYMPATHETIC

It runs in the vidian canal

Opens in to the ptergyopalatne fossa and supplies the pterygopalatine ganglion

“The vidian nerve consists of the presynaptic parasympathetic superficial petrosal nerve, which derives from the superior salivary nucleus; the postsynaptic sympathetic greater deep petrosal nerve, which derives from the glossopharyngeal nerve; and the pericarotid sympathetic nerve. On passing through the pterygoid canal, the vidian nerve emerges to join the sphenopalatine ganglion. The parasympathetic fibers synapse with cell bodies of the ganglion, and the sympathetic component of the vidian nerve passes through the ganglion. Pure sensory fibers from the maxillary nerve also pass through the ganglion. All these fibers form the posterior nasal nerve are relayed to the nasal mucosa through the sphenopalatine foramen. Although parasympathetic innervation of the nasal mucosa and the lacrimal glands is supplied mostly by the” ([Konno, 2010, p. 105](zotero://select/library/items/3DZFTK9W)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PX37FHW4?page=1&annotation=WU4SIRHV))

“parasympathetic component of the vidian nerve, sympathetic innervation derives not only from the vidian nerve but also from the periarterial nerve plexuses of the maxillary and ophthalmic arteries.” ([Konno, 2010, p. 106](zotero://select/library/items/3DZFTK9W)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PX37FHW4?page=2&annotation=9HP8ZRHP))
