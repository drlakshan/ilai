# Note

This can be safely done with the coblator
its a practice improvement




# Context:

Adenoidecomy is usually a blind procedure
with the help of coblator it can be done more thoroughly

“For Coblation adenoidectomy, after general anesthesia patient was placed in the supine position and Boyle- Davis mouth gag was inserted to open the mouth. Catheter was passed through the nostril to retract the soft palate. 4 mm or 2.7 mm 0 ° rigid nasal endoscope was passed through the nasal cavity to visualize the adenoids. The surgeon stood on the right side of patient and Coblation wand was introduced through the oral cavity to the nasopharynx. Under endoscopic guidance the adenoidectomy was performed (Fig. 1).” ([Hapalia et al., 2022, p. 1164](zotero://select/library/items/2R4NDQ7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKF88KW7?page=2&annotation=8C7QY4ZS))

“On the various parameters evaluated in this study to compare the 2 techniques, it is evident that Coblation adenoidectomy is better as compared to cold curettage adenoidectomy in terms of lesser intra-operative blood loss, shorter period of post-operative discomfort, and lower likelihood of injury to adjacent tissues, and precision of adenoid removal. For these reasons Coblation adenoidectomy should be the standard technique.” ([Hapalia et al., 2022, p. 1167](zotero://select/library/items/2R4NDQ7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKF88KW7?page=5&annotation=LIY4MCDF)) These are the advantages of the coblator assisted surgery and it makes sense for me to try and incorporate this in to the repertoire
