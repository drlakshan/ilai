######  Note

CONTEXT:
one of the chief critisms of the extracapsular dissection technique is that it might leave tumour behind. especially in pleomorphic salivary adenoma where there is psuudopodia. 

According the Mr Whit, who wrote the article ( I met this guy in Philadelphia AAO HNS meeting 2020), it really is. 

However we can combine this with Facial nerve dissection, [[ECD-FND]] then the recurrence rate should be lower.
