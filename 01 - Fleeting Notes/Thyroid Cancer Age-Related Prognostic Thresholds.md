# What Did I learn?

Age as universal prognostic variable across thyroid cancer subtypes.

#### Critical Age Thresholds
• **<45 years**: Lowest mortality risk across subtypes
• **45-55 years**: TNM staging transition point
• **≥55 years**: Independent adverse factor, staging significance
• **≥60 years**: Markedly increased mortality (HR ~30 at 10 years)
• **≥70 years**: Independent mortality risk factor (ATC)

#### Subtype-Specific Impact
• **PTC**: <55 rarely die from disease, progressive risk >45-60
• **FTC**: Similar age patterns to PTC
• **MTC**: >55 associated with advanced presentation
• **ATC**: <60-65 better therapy tolerance

#### Mechanistic Factors
• Decreased treatment tolerance older patients
• More aggressive tumor biology
• Delayed presentation patterns
• Reduced radioiodine avidity
