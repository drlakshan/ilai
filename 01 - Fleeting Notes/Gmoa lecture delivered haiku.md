Not much of prep
But a worn out path
Was able to battle it out
With ease and fluency 

Another coming up
But poor prep by admins
Any how I will do it
As it will light me up













context:

Invited to do a lecture on common ent conditions at gmoa. Did that well. Now I need to do a similar one at Anuradhapura. 
I usually combine that with religious spiritual development 
Let’s do that this time too
