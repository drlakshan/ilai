1. compartment syndrome dynamics : bony orbit rigid compartment, >40mmHg pressure rise; this becomes higher than the central retinal artery perfusion Central retinal artery mean pressure - intraoccular pressure
2. compression of central retinal artery and posterior cilliary arteries : retinal ganglions are exquisitely sensitive to ischaemia and starts degenerating after 60-90 minutes; this leads ischaemic demylination and Wallerian degeneration
3. venous congestion
4. beyond retina : optic nerve also gets ichaemic due to compressed pial and cilliary circulation
