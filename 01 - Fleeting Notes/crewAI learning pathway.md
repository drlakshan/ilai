1. installed the necessary software including vscode, poetry, pipx, php 12 and 11 
2. copied the starter template
3. made a copy of it using mv command
4. created pyproject.toml file with necessary requirements 
5. ran poetry run and created the the shell with poetry shell

Got the files created however even after defining the agents tasks tools as per the book, I get module not available error. So some more debugging to do. This is actually ok. I will learn new things. 
I need to keep at it.  Will do with perseverance correcting as I go along. 



After multiple attempts got the crewAi short course example to work!
it worked in Google CoLab
again need to thank Google for the opportunity
I am paying goolge anyway for the business account, plus account and youtube prime account
