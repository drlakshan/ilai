Howard Gardner says education must shift to fostering the relational functions - the respectful mind ( how we treat others) and the ethical mind ( how we make complex decisions) fundamentally human where as disciplined mind, synthesizing mind and creative mind can be taken over by the AI






# Context:

### Five Minds for the Future
This is Howard Gardner's framework outlining the five essential mental capacities that education should cultivate for the future: the disciplined mind, the synthesizing mind, the creative mind, the respectful mind, and the ethical mind. Gardner argues that as AI masters the purely cognitive functions (disciplined, synthesizing, creative), the primary responsibility of human education must shift to fostering the relational functions—the **respectful mind** (how we treat others) and the **ethical mind** (how we make complex decisions)—as these must remain fundamentally human domains.
