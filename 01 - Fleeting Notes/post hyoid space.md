# Note


The thyrohyoid ligament does'nt go straight from thyroid to hyoid.
It goes behind the hyoid and attaches to superior margin and epiglottis so that there is a space behind it. 

This is important as we can use that as a pointer to indentify hyoid bone



# Context:

In thyroglossal duct cyst excision hyoid body has to be removed and this space can be used to identify it.
