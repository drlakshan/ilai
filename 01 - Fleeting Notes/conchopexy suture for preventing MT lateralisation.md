The Conchopexy suture procedure adopted in this study was described by Lindemann et al.(6). Vicryl 3/0 (Ethicon) was passed through the antero-inferior part of middle turbinate and the ad- jacent nasal septum on one side and further passed through the antero-inferior part of middle turbinate on the other side. The suture was then traversed through the septum just anterior to the middle turbinate in patients who had FESS with septoplasty. Whilst those who underwent FESS only, the suture was passed through the cartilaginous septum to avoid the difficulty in passing the suture through the perpendicular plate of ethmoid which remained intact as septoplasty was not done.
