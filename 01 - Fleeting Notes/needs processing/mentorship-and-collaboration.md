# Mentorship and Collaboration

- Seek out mentors in your field of interest
- Look for both mentors (who give advice) and sponsors (who advocate for you)
- Collaborate with colleagues on projects to expand your network
- Be open to working with people outside your immediate specialty
- Offer to help senior colleagues with projects to gain experience
- Be a reliable collaborator to build a positive reputation
