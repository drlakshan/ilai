thank you very much for the kind words of introduction and I am delighted to be here today and without further ado lets move on to the topic at hand.

Introduction
Slides 1-4
I dont have to tell you what AI is, how it is revolutionary or how if used appropriately one can harness superpowers. You have already seen yourself and what my previous spoke of also would have given you some idea. by show of hands (or slido), in general how many of you think AI is overall a positive thing, overall a negative thing or neutral. 
second question, take a moment to send in how you use AI and what for. 
just to get an idea of the audience undergraduates, post graduates, clinicians, academics (university), some of you will fall in to multiple categories,

Transition
Let me be brief and say who I am what I intend to do. You already know about some of the academic and professional achievements. My quest is to have a controlled experiment of life using the available technology be it pen and paper, computer without internet (yes there was a time like that), computer with internet access and now with AI Super powers to do what I do best at the moment. Currenly at the role of a board certified consultant, head of research, medical education enthusiast and a director. so my promise to you is I will leave with you some thoughts and practical ways of using Ai to apply to your professional life today in a way how you feels right.
How does that sound?



Ok now that we know each other, lets move on to the meat of the presentation
how can we utiilise this wonderful technology to improve our professional life.

I would like to dissect out our professional life into following 8 aspects:
[[CCP Maximizing Your Potential How AI Can Enhance Your Professional Life Today - CCP lecture#**1. The Clinician – Master of Healing**]]


**1. The Clinician – Master of Healing**

**2. The Communicator – Translator of Medicine**

**3. The Educator – Shaping the Next Generation**

**4. The Leader & Collaborator – Orchestrating the Team**

**5. The Scholar – Lifelong Learner**

**6. The Advocate – Voice for Patients & Public Health**

**7. The Professional – Keeper of Ethics and Integrity**

**8. The Innovator – Improving Systems and Care**

while we can delve deep in to each and every aspect mentioned above taking the AI angle, time is not enough. So we need to choose

May I recommend, 
1. The Clinician
2. The Educator
3. The Scholar 

roles and expand a bit on those using a specific example and then show how that is specifically done. 

Are you Ok with that?

great!

then first lets move on to the first component; the clinician
one need to be great as diagnosis and applying evidence based management principles
great in theory sometimes impractical
how about if I teach you a method using AI you can get the latest reseach when you give the topic?
CUSTOM gem of latest medical research advisor. 
Is this always 100% accurate No but pretty much so. 
Can you learn be  a better clinician using this approach in a very short duration that you would not otherwise be able to HELL YES!


second situation: your role The educator:
you will have to teach your juniors, collaegues, and some times peers.
how should you go about doing this?
first how would you do without AI

lets say you want to teach diabetic ketoacidosis to final year professorial students in a lecture of 45 minutes
I have made the situation very specific so that we can dive deep in to it. 

you would find out about the specific and general objectives of the teaching event and then do some research at the level of the student (final year undergrads) and then prepare your PowerPoint Slides. 

Here is what you should not do:
prompt the LLM I am about to deliver a lecture to a group of final year medical students on Diabetic Ketoacidosis for 45 minutes, please make the slides and oh remember to add some picuture along the way. 

Here I would like to plug in some educational concepts
[[cognitive debt]], [[deliberate practice]],[[learning from productive failure - learning theories, how to apply them constructively TED talk Manu Kapur]]


I think it is best to define some constraints when using AI to this type of work as the whole purpose of this role is to develop set of neurones that fire together so that they wire together. and when you really need them to synthesise and fire together at the moment of need it should happen. 
Idea is to train your nervous system and make sure you are ready and not to be dependant on the technology - use AI to enhance your learning and teaching and so essentially you can not handover the entire process.

How I propose you do this is:

1. decide what you have to teach and think about it write about it ruminate about it do some stratergic procastination do not just jump straight into it.
2. sit down and have a structured approach to the lecture [[Lecture Preparation template]]
3. use appropriate tools at the appropriate level
4. I use another custom Ai to guide me along the pathway when I am thinking braodly however here we have a set structure
5. then once the outline has been done we can get the AI to feedback on your work.
6. iterate multiple times until you get the deck ready and then finalise
7. this is called [[FIXIT strategy for interaction with LLMs]]
8. then you can create slides. Here there is dichotomy apps, or human
9. images you can ask it. 
10. rehearse
11. get feedback
12. learn
13. [[deliberate practice]]


Finally lets move on to the role of Scholar
continuous learner
your own learning partner
enter NotebookLM
grounded in your own sources
carefully curated

lets take an example 
1. Simple Guideline  - OSA
2. Multiple Source - Tinnitus

One the digestion happens you MUST make NOTES. 
Flashcards [[6 strategies for learning according to science]]


So I hope based on the above example usecases you have a reasonable understanding how AI can be used to enhance professional life TODAY.
let me stress today!
its not just to say these are very practical you and you can go hope and apply them immediately
but also tomorrow I will tell you better tools better ways as the AI landscape is fast evolving. so As steve job said stay hungry stay foolish and learn aim for progress not perfection,

All the best!
