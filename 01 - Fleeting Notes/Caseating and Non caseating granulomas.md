# What Did I learn?

# Caseating vs Non-Caseating Granulomas

## Critical Histopathological Distinction
Presence/absence of central necrosis provides powerful clue to underlying etiology

## Caseating Granulomas
**Appearance**: Core of amorphous, cheese-like necrotic debris
**Mechanism**: Results from macrophage death
**Etiology**: Strongly suggestive of **infectious** cause
**Classic Disease**: Mycobacterium tuberculosis

## Non-Caseating Granulomas
**Appearance**: Tightly packed epithelioid cells without central necrotic core
**Etiology**: Hallmark of **non-infectious** inflammatory conditions
**Classic Disease**: Sarcoidosis
**Also Seen In**:
- Foreign body reactions
- Certain fungal infections (GIFRS)

## Clinical Significance
First-line histopathological differentiator in diagnostic workup of granulomatous disease
