[[Gradenigo Syndrome]]

“Over 4 decades, the number of surgeries performed appear to have decreased (Table I and Fig. 6). During the period 1971 through 1980, 50% were treated surgically. Between 1981 and 1990, 28.6% underwent major surgery. Between 1991 and 2010, 15.4% underwent surgery. Between 2001 and 2011, only 12.5% diagnosed patients underwent surgery.” ([Gadre and Chole, 2018, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/34DL6QBS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D9PH7R7S?page=4&annotation=L77I684B))
