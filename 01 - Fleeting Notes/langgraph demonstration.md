#AI 

Context:

I watched this video from the beginning to the end. 
He demonstrated clearly how two components, state and graph (made up of nodes (tools and agents) and edges) interact.
That high level understanding was clear to me.
As always what was not very clear was how the functions and coding part of the python as I am not a python developer. However how to use the boilerplate and templates is clear. what will be difficult is debugging but even that, with the help of LLMs I should be able to do.

Another problem is that

a. quality of the output
b. why can't I use the LLM straight up anyways?

is it accuracy?
is it privacy?

A good research project!
