Kite in the sky
waver anf pushed
wind and weather
mercy on the holder of the string

Indrakheela stay straight
come hell or highwater
independant and calm

when will the kite become an indrakheela?
time to change















context:

when you get bad / not welcome news, saw how the mind chemistry change
no need for that in this new life
