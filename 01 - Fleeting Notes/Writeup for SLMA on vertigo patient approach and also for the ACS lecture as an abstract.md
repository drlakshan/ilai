Vertigo / dizziness is common. Large population-based studies have shown an estimated
prevalence of about 15% to over 20% of adults yearly.

Human balance is affected by disorders of the inner ear, central neuronal pathways,
proprioceptors and visual pathways. Out of those, the commonest contribution is from the inner
ear - These conditions are also known as vestibular or peripheral vertigo.

Most of the vertigo patients can be sorted out with clinical assessment alone i.e., without
sophisticated tests. Unfortunately, these patients are poorly managed most of the time leading
not only to poor resolution of symptoms but making symptoms chronic and adding psychological
morbidity on top of imbalance.

In this presentation, we would like to present five clinical case situations and demonstrate how
to approach and manage a patient with vertigo.
The five situations discussed will be:
1. An Acutely ill patient
2. A patient with Positional Vertigo
3. A patient with Progressive loss of balance
4. A patient with Vertigo with headache
5. A patient with persistent Imbalance after acute vertigo

As the time is limited to 15 minutes, we are hoping to give an overview only. Resources
including a link to Google Classroom with detailed material will be given to the participants.
Latest research, clinical assessment techniques and diagnostic entities like Persistent
Perceptual Positional Dizziness will be introduced during the session.
