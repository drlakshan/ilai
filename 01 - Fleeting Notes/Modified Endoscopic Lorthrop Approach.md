When frontal sinusotomy fails, endoscopic modified Lothrop procedure (EMLP)—also known as frontal sinus drill‐out or Draf type III—allows for enlargement of the frontonasal communication by removing the frontal sinus floor, inter‐sinus septum, superior nasal septum, and frontal beak. As modified by Draf[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915830/#lio2145-bib-0002) and Gross[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915830/#lio2145-bib-0003) to be completely endonasal and endoscopic, 


EMLP has been increasingly utilized for a number of frontal sinus disorders, most commonly refractory chronic rhinosinusitis. Importantly, this endonasal approach to the anterior skull base has also become a viable alternative to anterior craniofacial resection. EMLP has largely replaced the open approach using the osteoplastic flap due to its reduced morbidity, improved cosmesis, ease of endoscopic surveillance, and decreased hospitalization and frontal pain
