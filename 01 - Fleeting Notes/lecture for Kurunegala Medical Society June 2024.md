What did I learn:

It was well organised. But I don't know whether I should do these. There are positives as some one may learn and I will get recognition, but at the same time, the opportunity cost , the hazzle etc. I am wondering whether its worthwhile to do that.

one thing I can do is an online lectures. 

I can also create an online class series where I teach online. somthing to think about. This will also has financial benefits in the future as well.
