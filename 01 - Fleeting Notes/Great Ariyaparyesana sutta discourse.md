**Aham-pi sudaṁ, bhikkhave, pubbe va sambodhā,**   
I also, monks, before the Awakening, 

**anabhisambuddho Bodhisatto va samāno,**   
while still an unawakened Bodhisatta,

**attanā jātidhammo samāno, jātidhammañ-ñeva pariyesāmi,**   
being myself subject to birth, sought out what was subject to birth,

**attanā jarādhammo samāno, jarādhammañ-ñeva pariyesāmi,**   
being myself subject to old-age, sought out what was subject to old-age,

**attanā byādhidhammo samāno, byādhidhammañ-ñeva pariyesāmi,**   
being myself subject to sickness, sought out what was subject to sickness,

**attanā maraṇadhammo samāno, maraṇadhammañ-ñeva pariyesāmi,**   
being myself subject to death, sought out what was subject to death,

**attanā sokadhammo samāno, sokadhammañ-ñeva pariyesāmi,**   
being myself subject to grief, sought out what was subject to grief,

**attanā saṅkilesadhammo samāno, saṅkilesadhammañ-ñeva pariyesāmi.**   
being myself subject to defilements, sought out what was subject to defilements



This sutta annotates beautifully how Maha Bodhisatta came to his enlightenment 
A wonderful journey of experimentation 
Through sathara per nimithi
ABHINISHKRAMANAYA
Alara Kaalama 
Uddaka Rāmaputta 
Akinchaayathanaya
Newasangnanasangayathanaya 
And transcending the universal consciousness in to enlightenment 



Another defining  moment 

**So kho ahaṁ, bhikkhave, tattheva nisīdiṁ:**  
Then, monks, I sat down right there,

**‘Alam-idaṁ padhānāyā.’ ti**  
thinking: ‘This is enough for striving.’

Once he has attained He comes back to give after being requested by Sahampathi Maha Brahma and upaka not seizing the opportunity and five co meditators doubting initially then
Agreeing to listened
Starting from rupa shabda ganda rasa pottabba how he is taken able the state of nothingness achicchayathana
To state of absence of perception and non perception newasangna na sangna level and going beyond this 
Is the attainment
