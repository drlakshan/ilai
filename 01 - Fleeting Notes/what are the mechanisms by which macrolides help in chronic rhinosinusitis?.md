[[mechanism of macrolides in non-eCRS]]
[[non eCRS]]
[[endotypes in sinusitis]]


1. Reduced cytokines IL8 IL6 IL-1β, TNF α TGF β
2. Inhibition of neutrophil recruitment 
3. Decreased mucus secretion
4. Increased mucociliary transport







# Reference


“Several mechanisms have already been identified in CRS, including reduced cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, inhibition of neutrophil recruitment, decreased mucus secretion, and increased mucociliary transport.” ([Ryu et al., 2023, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/DG9XSUBY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXBUKUTZ?page=1&annotation=RXJB5UD4))
