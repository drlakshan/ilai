Cal Newport talks about slow productivity and the fact that when you want to be good at something (in essence trying to improve productivity) it would be best to slow down and concentrate on the one thing that matters.

This resonates with me as I am developing a Patient Management System using Google Appscript and chatGPT. I have mixed feelings about using chatGPT but it definitely speeded up the development.
