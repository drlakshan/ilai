Nuwara Eliya break 
at the end of 2022
what a life it is
that unfolds before us

LIfe can be a challange
As it should be
tredding with care and deligence
we need to workout things

birth to the death
life needs to flow 
gracefully and peacefully
guided by experiences 







context:

In Nuwara Eliya with Akram Family
contemplating about life, learning and job
