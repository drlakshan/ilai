Nasal septal cartilage stays same and ethmoid perpendicular plate grows anteriorly causing nasal growth. 

Therefore septoplasty is ok in children just don’t remove bone and preserve bony cartilage junction

Preserve mucoperichondrial flaps, keeping them thick, and try to preserve nasal ligaments.  Septoplasty in children doesn't affect nasal growth if bone is preserved.<br>- Must be thorough with informed consent because trauma could have already affected nasal growth areas.  Also, the rate of revision surgery is close to 100%.  A conservative approach is always preferred, with a goal to improving nasal airflow, and more surgeries may be needed in the future.  Must document the degree of obstruction and findings that would support the initial surgery.<br><br>  <br>  <br>------------------------------  <br>Christopher Kennel MD, FAAOA  <br>Te Whatu Ora--Health New Zealand  <br>Te Matau a Māui--Hawke's Bay  <br>ckennel@gmail.com  <br>
