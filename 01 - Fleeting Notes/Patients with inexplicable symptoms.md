 A recurring thread on this and similar Forums is presentation and discussion of patients with odd or inexplicable symptoms.  I find that to be one of the more intriguing aspects of the Forum, and I always learn something useful even when I disagree with the conclusions.  There are several axioms that often apply here, but I always remember what my Dad taught me: "[[Common things are common. N Uncommon things are uncommon. Uncommon presentations of common things are more common than common presentations of uncommon things.]] Also, "Sick people look sick," and "Bad things get worse."  My Father is no prophet, but his advice always resonates with me as I work-up or discuss my patients.I tell many patients that they have "Blythe Syndrome," which you won't find in any textbook or medical journal.  "Blythe Syndrome" simply means, "I have absolutely no idea what is wrong with you."  I follow that diagnosis by saying, "I am going to say the 3 words no patient ever wants to hear: "I don't know."  Patients don't want to hear it, and physicians don't want to say it, but it has become increasingly important for me to be honest with my patients when I am not certain.  As much as I wish it were true, I am not brilliant like Spencer Payne or Christine Gourin, and[[ I have Forrest Gump'ed my way through most of my career. ]] My patients often seem to take comfort in my efforts and honesty, even when my ICD-10 code is a series of question marks.  
  
But discussions of patients with Inexplicable Symptoms often tell me as much about the physician as the patient.  This follows Dr. Pillsbury's rule that "When you are a hammer, the world looks like a nail."  I can often predict precisely what an author will say just by reading their name and knowing their biases, just as many of you can predict mine.  A person who works up and treats a lot of allergy, migraine, inner ear disorders, sinus headaches, reflux, subclinical hypothyroidism, food allergy, etc.. (as random ENT examples - I'm not calling anyone out) tends to find those diagnoses in their patients.  If you do not believe this, send your next patient with fatigue to a Rheumatologist, Endocrinologist, Sleep Doctor, Cardiologist and Pulmonologist and see how many different diagnoses and treatments you get.  We all have our biases, and there is nowhere it is more evident than in patients with Inexplicable Symptoms.  And I am as guilty as anyone.  
  
My approach to these patients is more pragmatic than academic:  
   1) Validate their complaints, take them seriously, and assure them that my ignorance and inability to diagnose them is not their fault.  That's on me.  
   2) Make sure there are no sharks in the water. Work them up like a bird dog: Perform a thorough and expert physical exam.  Bimanual palpation of everything. Scope.  Ultrasound. Audio.  CT. MRI. Labs. Allergy testing. Repeat.  I'm a surgical subspecialist, and I am unapologetic about using whatever tools are out there to help me when I'm not certain.  
   3) Follow them closely.  There is nothing like tincture of time and re-assessment to make confusing scenarios more clear.  I give every patient my card with my email address on it and say, "Next time it happens, email me and we will see you that day."  
   4) Get another set of eyes, ears and hands on them.  I am lucky because my wife is my CRNP, and she is smarter and kinder than I am.  It is not uncommon that I grab her and say, "I have no idea what is wrong with this patient, can you take a peek?"  She will often figure out what I have missed, primarily because she is a better listener than I am.  This follows my Dad's other rule, "Talk to the patient long enough and they will tell you what's wrong with them."  If Meredith can't figure it out, then the patient has "Double Blythe Syndrome," which nobody wants.  I bounce patients off my partners and colleagues quite often as well.   5) Always remain skeptical and suspicious.  Don't trust anything.  Reassess.  
   6) Many many patients respond well to common sense and healthy lifestyles, and none moreso than patients with Ménière's disease, migraine disorders, headaches, dizziness, chronic pain and globus.  People feel better physically when they feel better mentally, emotionally and spiritually.  
       -Stay lean.  Obesity is by far the biggest health issue we face in the US.  
       -Eat well.  Stay on the perimeter of the grocery store and eat fresh fruit and vegetables, lean meats and cheeses and complex carbohydrates only.  Drink water.  Don't drink 27 cups of coffee each day like I do.  
       -Get more sleep.  Everyone needs that.  
       -Get a little exercise.  Walk the dog.  Take the stairs.  Park as far away as you can from the door.  Mow your own lawn. Play with your kids.  
       -Don't do stupid things.  Smoking, drugs, drinking too much, etc…  
       -Go to church, temple, mosque, synagogue, meetings, etc.. occasionally.  There's one on every corner, so if one doesn't fit, pick another one.  The need for spirituality and transcendence is a ubiquitous part of being a human, it keeps us out of trouble, and it helps us manage stress.  Pray, even if you don't believe it.  It will make you feel better.  
       -Get rid of about 3/4 of all medications.  Most supplements are absolutely unnecessary.  Most medications are unnecessary as well if you follow the above steps.  (No, most people do NOT need ADD meds and sleep aids and anxiolytics and such.)  
  
None of that will fix a throat cancer, CRSwNP, bacterial infections or profound hearing loss.  But those common sense measures will get you out of a lot of sticky situations and help manage patients with inexplicable symptoms.  And if patients feel better, they generally ARE better, and we have done our job.
