| Principle                    | How AI Can Help                                                                                              | How AI Might Hinder                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deliberate Practice          | Provides personalized feedback and tracks progress over time.                                                | Could give generic feedback that doesn't truly help refine skills.                                        |
| Productive Failure           | Creates a safe space for trial and error, encouraging learning from mistakes.                                | Might give answers too quickly, preventing learners from truly struggling and learning.                   |
| Spaced Repetition            | Schedules reviews at optimal intervals to improve long-term memory.                                          | Could overwhelm learners with too many reviews or poorly timed intervals.                                 |
| Interleaving                 | Mixes different topics to help learners apply concepts flexibly.                                             | Might mix topics too randomly, causing confusion rather than clarity.                                     |
| Retrieval Practice           | Generates quizzes or prompts to strengthen memory by active recall.                                          | If it provides answers too easily, learners might not fully benefit from trying to remember on their own. |
| Growth Mindset               | Offers encouraging feedback to reinforce that effort leads to improvement.                                   | Could be overly critical or focus on mistakes, discouraging learners.                                     |
| Zone of Proximal Development | Adapts to the learner's level, providing the right hints to tackle challenges just beyond current abilities. | If not well-tuned, it might misjudge the learner's level and provide tasks that are too easy or too hard. |
