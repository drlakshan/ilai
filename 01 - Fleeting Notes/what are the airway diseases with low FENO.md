# What Did I learn?


in airway diseases where there is low level of oesinophilic inflammation [[type 2 Immunity]] Fractional Excretion of Nitric Oxide may ne low. 


three possibilities related to Asthma when low FENO <25 PPB
1. Good asthma control
2. Asthma is unlikely
3. Non-Eosinophiilc Asthma : corticosteroids might not work



# Context:

 A low FENO result can mean a few things:

   1. Asthma is Unlikely: If you have respiratory 
      symptoms but a low FENO score, it suggests that
       eosinophilic (allergic-type) airway 
      inflammation is not present, and your symptoms 
      might be due to something other than asthma.
   2. Non-Eosinophilic Asthma: You might have a type 
      of asthma that isn't driven by allergic 
      inflammation. In this case, inhaled 
      corticosteroids might not be the most effective
       treatment.
   3. Good Asthma Control: If you are already 
      diagnosed with asthma and are using inhaled 
      corticosteroids, a low FENO score is a good 
      sign. It indicates that your medication is 
      working effectively to control the 
      inflammation in your airways.
