######  Note

CONTEXT:




"shower for 20 mins make the symptom better"





Reasons

1. Steam and moistre soothe the throat
2. muscle relaxation
3. stress reduction
4. improved breathing causing less post nasal drip







Taking a 20-minute shower can help alleviate symptoms of globus sensation due to several factors:

5. **Steam and Moisture**: The warm steam from a shower can hydrate and soothe the throat, reducing irritation caused by dryness or postnasal drip. This can help relax the muscles in the throat and alleviate the sensation of a lump.
    
6. **Muscle Relaxation**: The warmth of the shower can relax tense muscles in the neck and throat, which are often associated with globus sensation. Muscle tension is a common cause of this condition, and the heat can help ease that tension.
    
7. **Stress Reduction**: Globus sensation is often linked to stress and anxiety. A warm shower can have a calming effect, reducing stress levels and, in turn, relieving the sensation of tightness in the throat.
    
8. **Improved Breathing**: Breathing in warm, moist air can help open up nasal passages and reduce postnasal drip, which is another potential trigger for globus sensation.
    

In summary, the combination of steam, warmth, and relaxation during a shower can address multiple factors contributing to globus sensation, providing temporary relief.
