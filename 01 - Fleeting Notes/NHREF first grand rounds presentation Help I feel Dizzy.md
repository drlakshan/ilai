so the day has come  I will be starting the grandrounds 
this is something I always wanted to
activate private sector educational attempts. 

idea is create a basic doctor aware of the possibilities

[I will be showcasing ENT aspects. ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1reoU0b98kRrwyFJukmh0A7atPebU1aM37mmg6YHPOMg/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=108226577663961778269)



flow of the talk: 
over the next 15 minutes or so I will talke you through the patient's journey and input ENT perspective to you at the very basic most level
So now we have a patient who has been assessed by the Emergency team and the Neurology and ruled out not be having a serious life threatening condition of any sort and although profusely symptomatic, we are not dealing with life and death here!

so how would and ENT specialist with vestibular training would approach this?
first of all through his mind the basics will flow
the main four systems that are involved in the human balance system, vestibular, visual, spinal and central nervous system, what are the characteristc / pathognomonic feaures eg swaying imbalance rather than true vertigo in the spinal system, long tract signs and symptoms altered level of consciousness etc in the central nervous system, tinnitus hearing loss and severe vertigo with peripheral vestibular system. actually it is easier to rule out visual and spinal systems and then concentrate on the main two players. how do we differentiate central vs peripheral causes of vertigo? 

second background knowledge you need is the common vertigo syndromes that are seen in patients.
here is a table of such analysis

third, you will need some understanding on how to diagnose these conditions


now that this patient has a positional vertigo a key element of examination is the Dix hallpike test. 
this how we do this 

Here is how a positive test looks like

now that the diagnosis is made we do not need any further investigations to manage this patient. The treatment is Epley manuevre and here is how we do that. 


Are there any other causes of course yes Meniere's disease, VN, Different types of canalolithisasis  however we will not be discussing those in detail due to lack of time. 

so lets summarise our grand round case discussion in the folllowing manner. 
History points that you need to elicit:

Examination points

Appropriate investigations and management
