I thought of thinking also in Obsidian. 

I have been journalling in Notion for over a year now. It works well. No issues. Only reason for shifting / rather giving a try here is to see whether this works . Especially because this is evolving as the second brain - quite nicely. It was very helpful to rake down information for the lecture and helping others out as well.
With the introduction of the canvas feature and becoming an insider, I am deeply in to this now. 
I will expand Obsidian vault and with it my understanding of the world and and ENT.

Yesterday I delivered a lecture at the SLMA using Audience response system as well It was well received I think. Hopefully I will be able to expand my presence in the academic world

I also signed up for a newsletter on obsidian by Eleanor Kornik and planning to expand the usage.

I hope to visit Kataragama tonight. and do a grand lecture tomorrow.
All the best for me
