# Mindfulness for Surgeons - ESRT Program

###### What Did I Learn?

Mindfulness-based interventions are evidence-based cognitive training tools, not just wellness practices. For surgeons, the Enhanced Stress Resilience Training (ESRT) program trains three core cognitive skills essential for peak performance in high-stakes surgical environments.

###### Core Cognitive Skills Trained by Mindfulness

* **Attentional Stability** - maintaining focus during complex procedures
* **Emotional Self-Regulation** - managing stress responses in the operating room
* **Perspective-Taking** - "frame shifting" to change relationship to surgical stress

###### Implementation Requirements

* Daily practice of at least 12 minutes for maximum benefit
* Tailored content designed by surgeons, for surgeons
* Context-sensitive to surgical stressors
* Instructors with relevant surgical experience

###### Available Resources

* **ESRT StrongMind app** - freely available digital platform
* International practice community access
* Evidence-based curriculum specific to surgical context

###### Context

Traditional mindfulness programs often fail to resonate with surgeons due to lack of contextual relevance. ESRT addresses this by:
- Using surgical-specific language and scenarios
- Understanding operating room culture
- Providing domain-specific stress management tools

This approach recognizes mindfulness as a **performance asset**, not just a stress reduction technique.
