“Zavegepant 10 mg nasal spray was efficacious in the acute treatment of migraine, with favourable tolerability and safety profiles. Additional trials are needed to establish the long-term safety and consistency of effect across attacks.” ([Lipton et al., 2023, p. 209](zotero://select/library/items/5LLCQUL7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GYU3HMCU?page=1&annotation=8ZZ6QNTN))
