this is intended to create a raw area so that will prevent lateralisation of MT after FESS

[[conchopexy suture for preventing MT lateralisation]]



Similarly, Bolgerization, originally described by Bolger et al.(8), was modified slightly in our study. Instead of using a sickle knife like Bolger did to create a 5x5 mm raw area on the medial aspect of antero-inferior portion of MT and adjacent nasal septum, microdebrider was used.
