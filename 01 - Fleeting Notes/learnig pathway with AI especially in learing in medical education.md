I wrote previously about how one can use new Ai tools in research.  I believe there is another  aspect that we need to concentrate. What aspect of teaching learning process that should not be tampered with. 
May be starting with a focuses problem and ideation solo has to be human 
Then at least one revision without Ai.
Then carefully curated / engineered prompt and a reliable AI who would give me worlds knowledge in a palatable manner. 
Then create a combined final outcome and iterate the whole process once and incubate with like minded before going worldwide. 


Let’s create a hypothetical scenario
Dr. DL is an ENT surgeon. He gets a patient with vesicular eruption over the left pinna. With his already existent knowledge he thinks this is likely to be zoster. But he wants to expand this more. 
Could this be another infection like Herpes Viral, rare form of bacteria, or an inflammatory skin disorder? Any other possibilities?
Now that he has found the focus, and ideated, now we can turn to AI. 
Now how?
1. A foundation model ?chatgpt ?claude ?gemini ?perplexity
2. Desktop version mobile version
3. How about API based interactions LLM
4. Should I type or have an audio interaction?
5. Do you need canvas feature? Do you want the Ai to expand the text? Is it best tow work within the creative suite of google drive?
