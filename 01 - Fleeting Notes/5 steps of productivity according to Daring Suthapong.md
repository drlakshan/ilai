###  Step 1: Get Things Done

This is the most fundamental level. The goal here is to **execute tasks** and stop feeling overwhelmed. If you have a long list of things to do, this is where you start. Focus on practical systems for task management, project organization, and time allocation. The key is to simply get tasks completed.

### Step 2: Get Organized

Once you can get things done, the next step is to **manage your information**. This is about creating a system to store all the knowledge, notes, and documents you need to complete your work. The goal is to have all the necessary information readily accessible so you don't waste time searching for it later. This level is about building a personal knowledge base.

### Step 3: Get Going

This level is about being **proactive**, not just reactive. Instead of only doing tasks that others give you, you decide what you should be working on. This involves setting goals and planning your actions. It's about moving from simply managing tasks to actively pursuing your objectives and making real progress.

### Step 4: Stretch Your Mind

This is the level of **learning and reflection**. The goal is to improve how you think, learn, and apply knowledge. This involves practices like journaling, mind mapping, and using systems to connect different ideas. The purpose is to gain a deeper understanding and wisdom that improves your decision-making and actions.

### Step 5: Get Aligned

This is the highest level, where you define your **life's purpose and values**. The goal is to use your personal mission, vision, and values as a compass for all your decisions. This ensures that your daily actions (Level 1) are in harmony with your long-term goals (Level 3) and ultimately lead to a life that is meaningful and fulfilling to you.
