Gist  of the Lecture

In this lecture I plan to discuss how a medical teacher can use Ai to enhance
1. Once own learning pathway
2. Become a better teacher
	1. teaching
	2. Evaluation
	3. Feedback
3. Organize one’s own life (optional)


I want to discuss tech technologies is like open AI ChatGPT perplexity Gemini, foundational models like these  and also maybe venture into research specific AI solutions such as consensus, scispace, reasearch rabbit, etc

I would like to break down the process of teaching and continuous medical education, and then maybe I can concentrate on the various components of the process so that I can give tailored solutions.


Teaching 

1. Choose the topic
2. Area of teaching content based on the curriculum,  level of expertise of the students, 
3. Create a lesson based on above
4. Create a delivery plan based on available teaching materials and resources

Evaluation
1. Personalized assessment plan
2. Answer assessment
3. Grading 

Future of education and universities 

Medical education 
Content facts
But shouldn’t the facts be taught?
Thinking blocks

Importance of critical thinking





Pyramid

may be lets start with thinking the basic way to think about cognition. then the concept of intelligence. then ways to enhance intelligence. what would it be like to use these technologies to achive this end. 
I think it may be best to think in roles we play eg surgeon/physician, lecturer,  marathon runner etc and then start with what you have and then build upon what you have 
concept of reciprocal apprenticeship

So basically the technology should augment our intelligence right?
For that these LLM s create a way to distill synthesize generate and present the information already available on the internet

Search —> analyze the information—> generate (canvas)

We need to make sure no error happens along the way 

We always say quality of training data will determine the quality of output similarly our decisions and working on these information also will depend on what we get out of these. So we have to make sure we intelligently analyze these steps and intervene intelligently. 

Learning teaching principles will hold. 
Like cognitive work you have to do 
Multi sensory input 
Thinking about these concepts on your own

I think following are the most useful use cases I have found
1. Showing my own thinking biases
2. Pharmacology reference
3. Summarise non mission critical articles
4. Learn English 
5. Mentorship


To see it’s the information provision part the majority of my work was done by me and in fact when I used the Ai to enhance my paragraphs I found it somewhat unsettling.


Remember Ai itself will not give you the advantage. Find your strengths and get AI to enhance those. 

I tried notebookLM to interogate about post tonsillectomy bleeding there was reference to epistaxis mangament as well

If your Ai work makes you think less not more be careful. If your Ai work saves time, physical effort, and improve efficiency you are on the right tract.
