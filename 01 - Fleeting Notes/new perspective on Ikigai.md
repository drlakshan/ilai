ikigai means to live a life worth living. live well 


	Ikigai (生き甲斐) is a Japanese concept that means "a reason for being." It is often described as the convergence of what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. Finding your ikigai is believed to bring fulfillment, happiness, and a sense of purpose to life.
	
	The Japanese word "Ikigai" is written as 生き甲斐. "Iki" (生き) means "life" or "being alive," and "kai" (甲斐) means "worth" or "value." So, Ikigai is often translated as "a reason for being" or "something that makes life worth living."
	
I came across [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/jR0U27wnH_c?si=h_PcNRSy3quP95QL)

and realised I may not have understood the concept clearly. It is not merely the intersection of the four circles (what you love, what you are good at, what people want, and what you can paid for). Apparently its a western adaptation of the concept. 

In japapenese tradition it is the act of doing something worthwhile according to your own understanding that gives you satisfaction IRRESPECTIVE of  external validation and monetary gains what Ikigai really means. 

Although when you do what that thing makes you happy and constantly and persistenly improve upon it it might ultimately lead to monetory gains, you do NOT focus on those aspects when you are cultivating your ikigai

lets look at the discussion I had with Gemini on this..

You've hit upon a key point of debate and misconception surrounding the concept of Ikigai, especially in the Western world versus its original Japanese meaning.

Here's my take, combining what the author states and what a broader Google search reveals:

**The Misconception of the Four-Circle Diagram:**

- **Western Adaptation:** The four-circle Venn diagram (what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for) that culminates in "Ikigai" at the center is largely a Western adaptation. It gained popularity through a blogger, Marc Winn, who applied the word "Ikigai" to a pre-existing "theory of purpose" diagram.
    
- **Focus on Profession/Career:** This diagram tends to push Ikigai towards a grand professional calling or "dream job." While it can be useful for career guidance, it doesn't fully encapsulate the broader, more nuanced Japanese concept.
    
- **Emphasis on External Validation/Monetization:** The "what you can be paid for" and "what the world needs" circles inherently introduce external pressures and a focus on benefit or social contribution, which the author (and many Japanese experts) argue can detract from the true, internal feeling of Ikigai. If your "Ikigai" disappears when the payment or external need does, it wasn't truly Ikigai in the deeper sense.
    

**The True Japanese Meaning of Ikigai:**

- **"A Reason for Being":** The literal translation of Ikigai is "a reason for being" or "what makes life worth living." It's derived from "iki" (life; alive) and "gai" (value or worth).
    
- **Small Joys, Everyday Life:** As the author emphasizes, and as many Japanese sources corroborate, Ikigai is often about the **small joys and everyday satisfactions** that make life meaningful. It's not necessarily a grand, life-changing purpose you "find," but rather something you experience daily. It can be as simple as the smell of morning coffee, a hobby, spending time with loved ones, or a sense of accomplishment in a small task.
    
- **Internal and Personal:** It's a deeply personal feeling that doesn't require external validation or financial reward. It's about what brings **you** joy and a sense of being alive, regardless of whether it's a skill, a job, or something society values in a monetary way.
    
- **Not Necessarily a "Goal":** It's not something you "achieve" but rather something that emerges through your daily experiences and appreciation for life. It can evolve and shift over time.
    

**Reconciling the Two:**

While the author strongly critiques the four-circle diagram as a misrepresentation of _true_ Ikigai, it's worth noting that:

- **A Tool, Not the Definition:** For some, the four-circle diagram can serve as a _tool_ for self-reflection to help identify areas where purpose, passion, and practicality might overlap. If, through this reflection, you discover an activity or pursuit that genuinely brings you that "small feeling of joy and life every day" (the author's definition), then the diagram might have incidentally led you to _your_ Ikigai.
    
- **Potential for Overlap, Not a Requirement:** It's possible that someone's true Ikigai _might_ happen to align with something they love, are good at, the world needs, and can be paid for. For example, a doctor who genuinely loves healing, excels at it, is meeting a societal need, and earns a living, might experience daily Ikigai through their work. However, the key is that the joy comes from the _process and internal feeling_, not the external benefits.
    
- **Beyond Career:** The biggest disconnect is when the four-circle diagram solely focuses on career. Many Japanese people find their Ikigai in family, hobbies, community involvement, or simply appreciating nature, none of which necessarily align with "what you can be paid for."
    

**In essence, the author's point, supported by many deeper explorations of Ikigai, is that the four-circle diagram often mistakes the _potential outcome_ of a fulfilling life for the _core definition_ of Ikigai itself.** Ikigai is the internal, daily feeling of worth and joy, not merely the intersection of external factors.
