Lets start yes again I don't mind starting again again. After all life is an iterative cycle. Cetain things might not change hopefully. like the obsidian. zotero and anki

I want to develop myself educationally and academically. 
and more importantly I want to develop the Buddhist within.

For this i have started meditating again in the morning. I am certain that It will help. Additionally I will be listening and contemplating on Deep Dhamma. I will develop as a person as a character and in many more ways than one. I will create a character and take things forward in a robust manner. 

I need to contemplate back on again on learning and I hope with the digital tools I have I will be able to be more productive. 


I was listening to a dhamma deshana where the focus was on irdi pada wadeema. 
I think I need to take that seriously
