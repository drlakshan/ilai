Hi Sir, 
Hope you are doing well! Sir, there has been many times you crossed both our(mudara’s and myself) minds but we were lost in the busy schedules and new life. So sorry for not being generous enough to send even a single text sir. 
However, sir yesterday Mudara had symptoms of BPPV and undeniably I wanted to find time to thank you. Thanks to you, I was able to handle the situation without panicking.
Thank you so much sir for sharing your knowledge without any hesitancy and for all the tips, tricks and guidance in clinical knowledge you shared with me during my brief service. 
Sir, I am really honored to have served you and you are one of the best mentors I have ever had!! 
I would call you a 5 star rated knowledge bank and a human full of human spirit and I wish every health care practitioners were dedicated and passionate towards their role just like you! 
Missing your guidance and ambiance of rich passion for knowledge and innovation! 
May you be able to do your beautiful service in better ways as always!! 
See you Sir! 🙏🧡

Romila
