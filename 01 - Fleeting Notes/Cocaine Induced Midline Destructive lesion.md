# Cocaine-Induced Midline Destructive Lesions (CIMDL)

## Pathology
**Mechanism**: Habitual nasal insufflation of cocaine
- Intense vasoconstriction
- Ischemic necrosis
- Extensive destruction of osteocartilaginous structures

## Clinical Presentation
**Structures Destroyed**:
- Nasal septum (perforation)
- Turbinates
- **Palate (perforation)** ← KEY FINDING

**Symptoms**:
- Nasal regurgitation of food
- Dysphagia
- Halitosis

## Diagnostic Challenge
**Clinical Overlap**: Closely mimics [[Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)]]
- Both clinically
- Both histologically

**Confounding Factor**: Significant portion of CIMDL patients test **ANCA-positive**

## KEY DIFFERENTIATOR - Palate Perforation
**CIMDL**: >70 reported cases with palate perforation
**GPA**: Exceptionally rare (poorly documented)

**Clinical Pearl**: Palate perforation in midline destructive lesion → strongly favors CIMDL over GPA

## Diagnostic Workup
**Essential Components**:
- Detailed substance use history
- Examination of palate
- ANCA testing (can be misleading)
- Biopsy (excludes malignancy, vasculitis)
