“The PPS is often defined as an inverted pyramid with the temporal bone at its base and the hyoid bone at the apex [1,6,12]. It is divided into the prestyloid and poststyloid compartments by fascia running from the styloid to the tensor veli palatini muscle. The anatomic structure within each compartment plays a large role in the differential for intra-compartmental lesions. The poststyloid compartment (carotid space) contains the great vessels, cranial nerves, cervical sympathetic chain, and lymph nodes whereas the prestyloid compartment is mainly composed of fat, the deep lobe of the parotid gland, lymph nodes, and a small branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve to the tensor veli palatini muscle [13–15]. Thus, prestyloid compartment lesions are predominately salivary gland masses, lymphomas, and lipomas whereas poststyloid lesions are more likely to be paragangliomas, nerve sheath tumors, lymphomas, connective tissue tumors, carotid aneurysms, and ganglioneuromas [12].” ([Dang et al., 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/R4J3VZZL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z89B8GNI?page=2&annotation=6AS7PEDV))
