“transverse process of the axis, 9.7 to 36.8 (mean 16.9);” ([“Landmarks of the facial nerve: implications for parotidectomy”, 2006, p. 170](zotero://select/library/items/PMJKTI5U)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UBHRZN5G?page=1&annotation=VUCA8TYW))

“This study advocates the use of the transverse process of the axis as it is easily palpated, does not require a complex dissection and ensures minimum risk of injury to the facial nerve trunk.” ([“Landmarks of the facial nerve: implications for parotidectomy”, 2006, p. 170](zotero://select/library/items/PMJKTI5U)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UBHRZN5G?page=1&annotation=DKPSSI6D)) The transverse process of the axis has been identified as a consistent landmark for locating the facial nerve trunk during parotid surgery [1] [2]. The distance between the facial nerve trunk and the transverse process of the axis ranged from 9.7 to 36.8 mm, with a mean distance of 16.9 mm [3]. This landmark is easily palpated and does not require complex dissection, making it a reliable and safe option for identifying the facial nerve trunk [4]. Additionally, the transverse process of the axis has been found to be a constant bony landmark in relation to the facial nerve trunk [5]. Using the transverse process of the axis as a surgical landmark can help minimize the risk of facial nerve injury during parotid surgery .
