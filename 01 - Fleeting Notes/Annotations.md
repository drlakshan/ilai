“Cluster headache is characterised by attacks of very severe, unilateral headache lasting 15–180 minutes, up to eight times per day. The attacks are associated with cranial autonomic symptoms on the same side and a sense of agitation or restlessness.” ([Ray et al., p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/EQPTFDH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N58WG7NE?page=1&annotation=KEEPLP2N))

“An anterior location of pain, sense of internal restlessness or agitation, and ipsilateral autonomic features (conjunctival injection, lacrimation, rhinorrhoea, eyelid oedema, sweating, miosis or ptosis) are highly suggestive of one of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias.” ([Ray et al., p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/EQPTFDH9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N58WG7NE?page=1&annotation=77I7NDWM))
