PFAPA syndrome is a rare autoinflammatory disorder that primarily affects children. It is the most common periodic fever syndrome in children, with most cases appearing by the age of five.

## Key Characteristics and Symptoms

Episodes typically involve:
- **High Fever:** Fevers over 102°F (38.9°C) that last 3 to 7 days and recur every 2 to 8 weeks.
- **Aphthous Stomatitis:** Mouth sores (canker sores).
- **Pharyngitis:** Sore throat.
- **Adenitis:** Swollen lymph nodes in the neck.

Other possible symptoms include fatigue, chills, joint pain, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache. Between episodes, children are usually healthy.

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is clinical and based on the characteristic symptoms and exclusion of other conditions. There is no specific lab test for PFAPA. During a febrile episode, inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are elevated.

## Treatment

Treatment aims to ease symptoms and shorten the duration of fever episodes.

### Acute Episode Management
- **Corticosteroids:** Single dose of prednisone/prednisolone (1-2 mg/kg, max 60 mg) can stop fever attack within hours
  - 92.5% response rate with fever resolution in 95% of patients within 24 hours
  - **Limitation:** May shorten intervals between episodes in 25-50% of patients
  - Does not prevent future episodes

### Preventive Treatments
- **Other Medications:** Cimetidine and colchicine may help prevent future episodes in some children

### Surgical Options
- **Tonsillectomy:** 91% complete resolution rate (moderate certainty evidence)
  - Reduces episode frequency from bimonthly to less than once per two years
  - Shortens episode duration from 3.5 to 1.7 days average
- **Tonsillotomy (2024):** Partial removal with lower morbidity
  - 88% cure rate at 3 months follow-up
  - 25% complete cure rate with significant symptom reduction in 69%

## Prognosis

PFAPA syndrome usually resolves on its own during the second decade of life, often by age 10, without causing long-term complications.
