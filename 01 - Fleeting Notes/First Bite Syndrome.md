 icl“First bite syndrome (FBS) refers to facial pain characterized by a severe cramping or spasm in the parotid region with the first bite of each meal that diminishes over the next several bites. It is a potential sequela of surgery involving the infratemporal fossa (ITF), parapharyngeal space (PPS), and/or deep lobe of the parotid gland. The constellation of symptoms varies from transient and mild to persistent and severe.1–4 The anatomic location most frequently associated with the development of postoperative FBS is the parapharyngeal space, and the mechanism is believed to be a loss of sympathetic innervation to the parotid gland.1,5” ([Linkov et al., 2012, p. 1773](zotero://select/library/items/CZDB9VAM)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7CU6LTIM?page=1&annotation=GDIRRPR5))
