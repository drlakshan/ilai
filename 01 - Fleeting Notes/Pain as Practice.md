  - what is the role of pain in practice
---

Pain, rejection, and loneliness act as feedback loops, not failures.  
They sharpen persistence and filter shallow motives.

**Practice Loop:**
1. Feel pain → reflect.
2. Translate reflection → action.
3. Rebuild → repeat.

**Key quote:**  
“Pain is your coach. Loneliness is your gym. Rejection is your teacher.” Jack Ma
