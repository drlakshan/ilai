Research Question:


how long do we have before blindness sets in when there is orbital haemorrhage
In patients who under go surgery closed to orbit eg. functional endoscopic sinus surgery and get bleeding into the orbit bleeding in to the orbit blindness is a complication how much time is there before irreversible damage happens?


updated from chatGPT
> _In patients who develop orbital haemorrhage as a complication of surgery near the orbit—such as functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)—what is the critical time window from onset of orbital compartment syndrome to irreversible visual loss, and what pathophysiological mechanisms determine this time limit?_
