Note 1: Kihon - Mastery Through Fundamentals

True mastery in any skill is not achieved by learning countless advanced techniques, but by perfecting the fundamental techniques (Kihon). Even masters continuously practice the basics, as excellence stems from applying these core principles perfectly in thousands of different situations.

Note 2: Zansin - The Principle of Complete Follow-Through

Zansin, or "remaining mind," is the principle of maintaining full awareness and follow-through. An action is only truly finished not when the main work is done, but after it has been completely reviewed, polished, and brought to the highest standard, separating good work from exceptional work.


Note 3: Fudosin - Cultivating an Immovable Mind

Fudosin, or "immovable mind," is the development of a calm and focused spirit that remains unshaken by challenges, distractions, criticism, or failure. This mental strength is built by repeatedly choosing to continue and practice, separating emotions from actions, and carrying one through the long journey to mastery.
