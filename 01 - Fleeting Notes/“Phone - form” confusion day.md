We were late for school. Late in the sense, later than the usual departure time. There were some important letters to be submitted including one for giving permission for following English medium course. There was a form for it. In the rush I printed it out and gave Apsara. As we were leaving the place she said the forms were not there. I was furious and then in confusion I asked them to do down while I fetched the forms. To see what she had meant was phones. When I tried to call her to get a clarification I noticed the phones were at the table and got further angered. I had somewhat calmness not to get too angry. That’s a win. I also had to come behind an ever so slow driver. With fuming wife I the car. She is extremely confused and we need to calm down.
