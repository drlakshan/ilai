Another significant event is setting up of communication devices. Today I went back to pixel for Nawaloka Calls and Iphone is kept for personal number(s).
I have 4 numbers to juggle with. Nawaloka Number 0763495665 my personal number 0713061919, Channel bookings 0717799499 and secret dialog number 0777689574 
As it is now, 0717799499 which is my practice hotline is kept in iphone se at my office for channel bookings and patient communications. 0763495665 is kept for nawaloka communications. 0713061919 is kept for personal codes, banking etc. 0777 689574 for no definitive reason. 

When planning the future with the devices use following has to be to thought of. 

1. Keep the devices to minimum. 
2. Synchronisation
3. Privacy 
4. ability to hand over the equipment without any security threat
5. least distractibility

However there is another obstacle that has come up. Mobile phone not working properly.
