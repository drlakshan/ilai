When I reframed my thinking to Sales-Income=Expenses, things started to shift.
	
	
	
	1.	Set Up Multiple Accounts: Income, Profit, Taxes, Operating Expenses.
	2.	Determine Percentages: Allocate a portion of income to each account.
	3.	Allocate Income: Distribute income according to set percentages.
	4.	Pay Yourself First: Transfer profit to personal account.
	5.	Pay Bills Last: Cover expenses with remaining funds.

In my case
HNB works as operating expenses accounts
Ndb
Combank
