## Clinical Features
- Rhythmic tremor in the voice, especially during sustained phonation.
- May be associated with tremor in other body parts (e.g., hands, head).
- Can worsen with stress or fatigue.

## Diagnostic Workup
- **Laryngoscopy/Stroboscopy**: To visualize the rhythmic adduction and abduction of the vocal folds.
- **Acoustic Analysis**: To quantify the frequency and amplitude of the tremor.
- **Neurological Evaluation**: To rule out other conditions and assess for associated tremors.

## Treatment Options
- **Medical Management**:
    - Beta-blockers (e.g., Propranolol)
    - Anticonvulsants (e.g., Primidone)
- **Botulinum Toxin (Botox) Injections**: Into the laryngeal muscles.
