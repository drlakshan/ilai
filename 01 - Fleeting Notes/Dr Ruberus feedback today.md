Lakshan. I received a lot of praise about you from two patients. Mr. Yuvanjan whose wife you saw and Mr. Piyasiri. Keep up the good work and the compassion and loving kindness which is guiding you in your practice. You are sailing well away from the common stream which has brought a lot of anguish to patients who come seeking a sympathetic ear. On this note I am sending you some verses I wrote decades ago which explains the very essence of being a doctor.
