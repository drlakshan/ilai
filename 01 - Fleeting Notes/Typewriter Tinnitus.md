“Vascular Conflict of Cranial Nerve VIII: Typewriter Tinnitus This characteristic unilateral 
intermittent tinnitus is a form of tinnitus that occurs when a blood vessel (anterior-inferior cerebellar artery) is in close contact with the auditory nerve at its entrance into the brainstem. Tinnitus is described as sounding like a typewriter, Morse code, or machine-gun. Hearing loss usually manifests at tinnitus frequencies. If the vascular conflict affects the facial and/or the vestibular nerve, associated ipsilateral hemifacial spasms, otalgia, or vertiginous spells might occur.54 Because typewriter tinnitus responds very well to carbamazepine,55 the medication response is proposed to be used as diagnostic tool.56 Tinnitus probably results from hyperactivity in the cochlear nerve generated by the conflict with the artery.57” ([Coelho et al., 2020, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/RDJYHEWQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R5H4NSZY?page=8&annotation=CLU9LZ9D))
