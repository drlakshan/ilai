I was listening to a podcast by Harvard Business Review where they were discussing concept of leadership, one of the most important things, they highlighted was that start with the “why “. Because if you don’t have a clear understanding, why you want it, leadership role, then you are bound to face, disappointments and failures. 

applying that to my own practice what I realize is that is I concentrate on the ”why” of my practice that is to help poor patients get relieved of their suffering with the best of my ability. 

Then I get my success guaranteed. Ultimately the entire business of patient care is to attain full enlightenment.
