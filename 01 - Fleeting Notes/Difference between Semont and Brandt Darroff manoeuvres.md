**Key Differences:**

**Purpose:** The Semont maneuver is primarily aimed at repositioning the displaced otoconia, whereas Brandt-Daroff exercises focus on habituating the brain to the abnormal signals from the inner ear

**Performance:** The Semont maneuver is typically performed by a healthcare provider, whereas Brandt-Daroff exercises are performed by the patient at home

Mechanism:** The Semont maneuver involves specific head and body position changes to reposition the otoconia, whereas Brandt-Daroff exercises involve repetitive movements to habituate the brain

**Effectiveness:** Both the Semont maneuver and Brandt-Daroff exercises have been shown to be effective in treating BPPV, with the Semont maneuver often providing more immediate relief and the Brandt-Daroff exercises offering longer-term habituation
