Ask the audience to sit straight
and ask them to raise their hands above their head
then ask them to go even further
and thats it!
what it showed was that when we do things we don't give the maximum and we can go even further should we decide to do

this can be applied to the [[Kaizen Technique]]
do something simple and something easy and repeat
