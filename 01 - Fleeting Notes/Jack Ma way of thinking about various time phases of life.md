One’s focus and risk taking should evolve with age:

• Before 20 years old: Focus on learning and acquiring knowledge.

• Between 20 and 30 years old: Work for a good boss in a good company to learn how to do things properly.

• Between 30 and 40 years old: If you want to do something yourself, just do it.

• Between 40 and 50 years old: Focus on the things you are good at, rather than trying new fields.

• Between 50 and 60 years old: Work to support young people, helping them to realize their potential.

• After 60 years old: Spend time on yourself, relaxing and enjoying life.
