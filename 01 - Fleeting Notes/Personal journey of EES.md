Today, I would like to share with you a journey that intertwines professional growth, academic pursuit, and the advancement of otologic surgery.

In 2016, my career reached a significant milestone when I was awarded the prestigious D.J. Premachandra Award. This accolade propelled me to further expand my expertise in otology. Seeking advanced knowledge, I traveled to Birmingham, UK, to partake in an advanced Otology course led by the esteemed Mr. Richard Harvey and his team. This experience was transformative, allowing me to observe the remarkable work of Chris Coulson in Endoscopic Ear Surgery (EES). The practical, hands-on aspect of the course further solidified my skills.

Upon my return to Sri Lanka, I embarked on a mission to broaden the scope of otologic services offered in our region. Progressing from standard myringoplasties, I ventured into more complex territories, including the challenging but rewarding task of glomus tumor excision. My initial findings and experiences were published in the Ceylon Journal of Otorhinolaryngology in 2019, marking a significant contribution to our local medical literature.

2023 marked another milestone, as I had the honor of having my abstract accepted for presentation at the prestigious IFOS Dubai conference. This international recognition is not just a personal achievement but a testament to the growing capabilities and expertise within our local ENT community.

Furthering my commitment to the field, I became a member of the Endoscopic Ear Surgery section of the American Academy of Otolaryngologists and Head and Neck Surgeons. This membership has been instrumental in keeping me abreast of the latest developments and best practices in otologic surgery.

I also had the privilege of conducting a workshop on endoscopic ear surgery at the Annual General Meeting of the College of Otorhinolaryngologists of Sri Lanka, alongside the esteemed Dr. Akram Drahaman. This event was a significant step in promoting and sharing knowledge within our community.
 

As of now, I have completed over 250 cases, each contributing to my experience and understanding of the intricate world of ear surgery. This journey is not just mine but a reflection of the collective effort and progress of our ENT community.

Thank you for allowing me to share my journey with you. Let’s continue to strive for excellence and innovation in the field of otology
