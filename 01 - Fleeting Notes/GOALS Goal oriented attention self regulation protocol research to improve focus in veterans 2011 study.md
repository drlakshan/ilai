The Goal-Oriented Attentional Self-Regulation (GOALS) training protocol involves teaching participants to perform frequent "self-checkups" to monitor their attention and focus on goal-relevant tasks. While the search results don't provide specific details on how these self-checkups were conducted, we can infer some information based on the overall approach of the GOALS training:

The self-checkups were likely implemented as a cognitive strategy that participants were taught to use regularly throughout their daily activities[1][3]. The core of this strategy involves:

1. Stopping current activity momentarily
2. Assessing whether attention is still focused on the intended goal
3. If distracted, using the "Stop, relax, refocus" mantra to redirect attention

Participants were probably instructed to perform these self-checkups at regular intervals or whenever they noticed their attention wandering. The "Stop, relax, refocus" mantra serves as a structured method to help participants:

1. Stop: Pause current thoughts or actions
2. Relax: Take a moment to disengage from distractions
3. Refocus: Deliberately redirect attention back to the goal-relevant task

This technique aims to improve executive functioning by enhancing attentional control and goal-directed behavior[2]. The training likely emphasized applying these self-regulation skills to participant-defined goals and real-world tasks, making the strategy more relevant and applicable to their daily lives[3].

The GOALS training protocol was implemented over a 5-week period, suggesting that participants had time to practice and internalize this self-checkup technique[2]. As participants became more proficient in using this strategy, they may have been able to perform these self-checkups more quickly and automatically in various situations.

It's worth noting that this approach showed promising results, with participants demonstrating significant improvements in measures of attention, executive function, and complex functional task performance after completing the GOALS training[2][3]. Additionally, many participants reported continued use of at least one trained strategy in their daily lives up to 2 years post-training, indicating the long-term applicability of these self-regulation techniques[4].
