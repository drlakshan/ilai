# Note


This is a great area to inject 1:100,000 Adrenaline (1:80,000)
that will anaesthetise the anterior palate and also act as a bleeding controller/preventer in nasal surgery

Palpate for a depression
Just medial to 2nd Molar
close to the gum line
Approach from opposite side

# Context:

In nasal surgery particularly when there is a risk of bleeding, this block is useful

“It is located by placing a finger in the mouth and palpating the hard and soft palate’s junction. The finger is drawn anterior to the hard palate’s posterior rim for 3–5 mm until the foramen is felt. We usually find the foramen in the transverse line drawn from the posterior margin of the second upper molar to the other side. We insert a 26-gauge needle in the greater palatine canal at a depth of 20–25 mm. After aspiration to exclude intravascular penetration, 2 ml of xylocaine 2% with 1:100,000 adrenaline was slowly injected (Fig. 1), and we confirm that the infiltration is successful by the mucosal blanching around the greater palatine foramen in the oral cavity [7].” ([Kamel et al., 2022, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/JS6RUP6G)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LQ269BJC?page=2&annotation=E3FC36PD))
