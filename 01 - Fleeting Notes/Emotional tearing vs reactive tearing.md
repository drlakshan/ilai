  - why vidian neurectomy can cause loss of emotional tearing but reactive tearing is intact?

there are two tear production pathways

1. Reflex Tearing : Trigminal nerve --> Brainstem --> facical nerve --> chorday tymapni --> submandibular ganglion --> lacrimal gland
	1. triggers : corneal irritation bright light foreign bodies onion vapors


2. Emotional tearing : Higher cortical areas : superior salivatory nucleus --> greater petrosal nerve --> vidian nerve --> pterygopalatine ganglion --. lacrimal nerve --> lacrimal gland
	1. triggers : emotions : stress, pain, laughter, yawning
	2. central emotional processing --> parasympathetic activation

⏺ Emotional vs Reflex Tearing After Vidian Nerve Injury

  Tear Production Pathways

  Reflex Tearing (Preserved)

  - Pathway: Trigeminal nerve (CN V) → brainstem → facial
  nerve → chorda tympani → submandibular ganglion → lacrimal
  gland
  - Triggers: Corneal irritation, bright light, foreign
  bodies, onion vapors
  - Mechanism: Direct sensory stimulation → reflex arc
  - Clinical significance: Remains intact after vidian nerve
  injury

  Emotional Tearing (Lost)

  - Pathway: Higher cortical centers → superior salivatory
  nucleus → greater petrosal nerve → vidian nerve →
  pterygopalatine ganglion → lacrimal nerve → lacrimal gland
  - Triggers: Emotions, stress, pain, laughter, yawning
  - Mechanism: Central emotional processing → parasympathetic
   activation
  - Clinical significance: Lost after vidian nerve injury

  Clinical Implications

  Patient Presentation

  - Can still tear when dust gets in eye (reflex intact)
  - Cannot tear when watching sad movies or crying (emotional
   pathway disrupted)
  - May develop chronic dry eye symptoms
  - Subjective feeling of "inability to cry properly"

  Surgical Considerations

  During transpterygoid approaches to skull base:
  - Inevitable: Some degree of vidian nerve dysfunction
  - Counseling: Inform patients about emotional tearing loss
  - Management: Artificial tears, punctal plugs if severe
  - Recovery: Variable - some patients adapt, others need
  long-term management

  Quality of Life Impact

  - Psychological distress from inability to express emotions
   through tears
  - Social implications during grief or emotional moments
  - Functional dry eye requiring ongoing treatment
