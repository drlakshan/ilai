Reference 

someone who is determined or stoic in the face of adversity, or who doesn't show their feelings when they are upset

The phrase is often used to describe British people who remain unemotional when faced with adversity. For example, "I know you're upset about losing the game, but keep a stiff upper lip". The phrase likely alludes to the trembling lips that precede bursting into tears.
