# Reference 

The acronym VUCA, for example—for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity—so often used today to describe our business environment, was originally coined by military leaders to describe the unpredictability of the changes triggered by the end of the Cold War. In the post–Cold War era, no longer were there two powers facing off—Us and Them; Democratic and Soviet; individualist vs. collectivist. Suddenly the geopolitical landscape looked less Rothko, more Jackson Pollock. Highly fragmented, nebulous, multilateral parties operated within and across national borders with dynamic motivations that couldn’t be anticipated, let alone tracked.
