###### how long should you treat acute migraine attack
2022-12-19- 22:58





######  Note

abortive treatment should be used less than two to three days per week


CONTEXT:

Need to know how long to continue acute treatment. I usually give for 3 to 5 days
I think this is too much
now I will say something like
to give at the onset and repeat Zolmitriptan 2.5mg BD for 48 hours maximum
or use Zolmit spray
