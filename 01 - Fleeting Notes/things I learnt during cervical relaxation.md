Last three days of cervical relaxation. 
total of 19 days
already 16 gone
surgery was done on the 18th and on the 17th I god admitted [[17-02-2025]]


now I need to summarise and wind down 
first of all about the decision, I am happy about how the decision was taken. 

then about the things I learnt. 
I started by studying Raycast and i am happy about the features I learnt ,decided not to use the pro version because of the cost and the fact that I am not using Ai features. It is not inherently bad or anything just that I have different workflows already created and now working well. 

Then I learnt about n8n platform and did couple of workflows.
