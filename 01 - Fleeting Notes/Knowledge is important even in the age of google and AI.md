# The Knowledge-as-Prerequisite Principle

Genuine understanding and the ability to even ask relevant questions are contingent upon possessing foundational knowledge. The modern myth that search engines like Google eliminate the need for knowledge is pernicious; information accessibility is not a substitute for deep, structured understanding. Without prior knowledge, one cannot effectively interpret search results or discern misinformation from fact.

This principle is critical in medical education, where a student cannot use a clinical database or interpret a study without a firm grasp of foundational anatomy, physiology, and pathology.

*   Information is not the same as understanding.
*   Foundational knowledge is required to formulate effective questions.
*   Existing knowledge is the filter through which new information is interpreted and validated.
