**December 9th 2024**

Lets look back at 2024. 
Great Year!
I started this year with a **shift of residence from Edmonton to on320**
I still own both properties. Moving to a lesser spaced but a facility rich apartment was a great decision
1. it helped me personally to maximise my time by reducing the transit time, reducing the tiredness 
2. it helped me to be healthier as i started using the Gym Frequently and started walking daily in the walking path
3. Business centre was very useful for me to do hours and hours of work without interruptions
4. I found the small canopy at the end of the smaller water pool very soothing and helpful for my work
5. As a inhabitant I realised how to live with minimal materials and I developed and used 3 Bag Concept of living
6. For my family bonding between the girls improved and they are now the best of friends
7. Apsara found it very easy to manage her work and look after kids
8. We renovated and rented out Edmonton to a foreigner on long term lease. 

Mental development wise I am now fully present. Sathi Nimittha was developed with the daily practice of panchabala.

I used Obsidian journalling and tracker app consistently to guide myself over the year 2024

**Time and Focus** were selected as the most important assets that I possess and Tried to use them very carefully.

**Practice, Training and Reflection PTR** [[30-11-2023]]

**AI** became a great part of my life. Its my thought partner and my apprentice that helps me with my thinking. It did not replace but augmented my thinking. I used it extensively in planning, learning and executions and that brought immense value to my services

I have a **great practice**. I see 60 patients a day and perform 60 Majors a month. That's a great clinical work output. I have structured my worklife so that I dont get inundated with work. I earn 6MM on average.

Academically: **Scientific Lakshan** [[13-12-2023]] Program that I initiated towards the latter part of 2023 blossomed in 2024. I delivered an excellent oration which was warmly welcome by the audience. [[Oration on Endoscopic Ear Surgery 2024 CORLHNS]]
I **published** 6 articles and delivered 5 lectures. Conducted training for the UoK BSc and MBBS students. I got involved with the private medical school teaching and organising of the Nawaloka Hospital Academic Congress. Cough Interest Group and Tinnitus Interest Groups are functioning well. I am using Obsidian to collect my knowledge and with the help of mobile syncing i can be updated anywhere and everywhere. Combination of Zotero, Obsidian and Anki **ZOA workflow** is really polished now

I improved **Arogya** to be a great companion for my service delivery. There is a mobile app for my patients to see their prescriptions, chat with me, get the information about their diseases etc

**Reading** became my hobby. I read 15 books. With the annotation feature on kindle I digest the concepts fully. 

**Communication development** became the theme is the year. 

I developed an eloquent system so that **50 weeks leading up to age 50** was well spent.
