using this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeTnndXyJQI) I managed to get claude desktop to communicate with a test obsidian vault and it worked - somewhat
I managed to get similar results using msty and it did not break.
I think  it may be becuase I am using the free version and the context window is limited. 
how I got that to use it 

1. insalled UV
2. installed a MCP server recommended in the video discription
3. installed claude desktop 
4. adjust the config file of claude to include the MCP json
