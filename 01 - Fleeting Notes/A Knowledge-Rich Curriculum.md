# A Knowledge-Rich Curriculum

A knowledge-rich curriculum is defined by three key characteristics: it is content-rich, coherent, and clear. It balances the transmission of factual knowledge with the development of competencies, avoiding the pitfalls of pure rote learning or content-free skill-building.

1.  **Content-Rich**: Prioritizes rigorous, substantial, and specific knowledge.
2.  **Coherent**: It is sequenced logically, both vertically (building on prior concepts) and horizontally (connecting concepts across disciplines).
3.  **Clear**: It specifies what needs to be taught and when, providing clear goals for both teachers and students.

This framework is essential for designing effective medical school curricula that build expertise logically and systematically.
