1. negative intra-plueral pressure secondary to vigorous inspiratory efforts on a obstructed airway
2. Muller or reverese Valsalva Maneuver
3. negative intraplural pressure --> decrease  intersitial hydrostatic pressure --> increases venous return --> increases left ventricular afterload
5. increased sympathetic activity, hypertension and central displacement of the blood volume



lead to acute pulmonary oedema by increasing transcapillary pressure gradient
