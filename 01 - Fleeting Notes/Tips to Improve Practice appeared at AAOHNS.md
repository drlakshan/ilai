This is a summary of things that I learn that I would like to incoroporate in to my practice.


1. Nerve Monitoring to ear surgeries : they mentioned to every, but atleast to cholesteatoma surgery if I can, that may be useful. And as they say when you use it regularly, although you may not need it most of the time, the day you want it, it will be familiar.
2. Endoscopic CSF repair [[corridors of endoscopic repair of CSF leaks]] to be started
3. Approaches to Frontal sinus [[Draf Type 1 Frontal Recess Approach]] , [[Draf Type 2A frontal sinus approach]] , [[Draf 2B frontal sinus approach]], [[Draf type 3 frontal sinus approach - Endoscopic Lorthrop]] , [[Modified Endoscopic Lorthrop Approach]]
4. Incoroporate Google Reviews Get the practice website up and running
5. Summarise surgeries done for the last year
6. In Lobectomy devide the isthmus early
7. Surgery cards just like check lists I created
8. ? telemedicine preop visit
