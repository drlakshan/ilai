Vision

 * Focus: Future-oriented, focusing on the ultimate goal and impact.
 * Purpose: To inspire and motivate stakeholders, providing a clear sense of direction.
 * Example: "To be the world's leading provider of sustainable energy solutions."
Mission

Key Differences Summarized
| Feature | Vision Statement | Mission Statement |
|---|---|---|
| Time orientation | Future | Present |
| Focus | What the organization wants to become | What the organization does |
| Purpose | Inspiration and direction | Action and implementation |
| Scope | Broad and aspirational | Specific and actionable |
Analogy
Think of a journey. The vision is the destination you want to reach, while the mission is the roadmap and vehicle you'll use to get there.
In essence:
 * A vision statement is the "why" behind an organization's existence.
 * A mission statement is the "how" the organization will fulfill its vision.
Both vision and mission statements are crucial for organizational success. They provide a sense of purpose, guide strategic planning, and help align the efforts of everyone involved.
