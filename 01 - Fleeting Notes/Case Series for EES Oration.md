“Abstract Introduction: Endoscopic Ear Surgery was introduced in the 1980s and has gained popularity worldwide. Superior view, better access to difficult corners of the middle ear, and better ergonomics have been cited as the reasons for its success. It's a very well-established approach for managing ear cases. We are presenting our experience herewith. Objectives: To assess efficacy of endoscopic ear surgery in local setting Methods Otologic surgical patients attending Nawaloka ENT unit were selected for endoscopic approach with the sole exclusion criteria of extensive cholesteatoma. Data collected using a digital portfolio system. Patients were followed up at 1 week, 2 weeks 1 month and 2 months. Period of study was from March 2017 to December 2019.

Introduction:

Endoscopic Ear Surgery has gained popularity worldwide. Superior view, better access to difficult corners of the middle ear, and better ergonomics with heads up surgery technique have been cited as the reasons for its success.  We are presenting our experience herewith.

  

Objectives:

To assess efficacy of endoscopic ear surgery in local setting

  

Methods

Patients attending Nawaloka ENT unit were selected for endoscopic approach with sole exclusion criteria of extensive cholesteatoma. Data collected using a digital portfolio system. Patients were followed up at 1 week, 2 weeks 1 month and 2 months. Period of study was from March 2017 to April 2022. 

  

Results

Total number of cases 190 (Myringoplasty 147, Mastoid exploration 31, Excision of Glomus Tympanicum 2, Stapedectomy 6, Excision of osteoma 4. Additionally all grommet insertions and examination under anaesthesia of ears (EUA EARS) were carried out endoscopically. 

  

In suppurative ear cases a success rate (as defined by dry ear without residual perforation) of 97.19% (175/178) was achieved. Grommet insertions were done without difficulty and all cases had in situ grommets at follow up. 5 Stapedectomy patients had a closed air bone gap. One patient had a perilymphatic gusher and persistent conductive hearing loss.One glomus tumour excision had a residual perforation, the other had no complications. 

  

Conclusions

Endoscopic ear surgery is an excellent method of attending to ear pathologies. With time and future developments, it might become the mainstay method of ear surgery.
