# The Role of Long-Term Memory in Learning

What is stored in long-term memory is the primary determinant of how quickly and efficiently new concepts can be learned. Learning is fundamentally an act of making connections between new information and pre-existing knowledge. Retrieving this stored knowledge frees up finite working memory, increasing its capacity to handle complex new information.

In clinical practice, an experienced surgeon's vast store of knowledge in long-term memory allows them to process new, unexpected information in the operating theatre far more efficiently than a novice.

*   Knowledge stored in long-term memory dictates the speed of new learning.
*   Learning connects new information to existing mental schemas.
*   "Knowledge begets knowledge," making the acquisition of complex material easier over time.
