# 4D CT for Parathyroid

4D CT (Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography) is an advanced imaging technique used for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas in patients with hyperparathyroidism. The technique has become increasingly important in parathyroid surgery planning.

## Key features of 4D CT:

1. **What "4D" means**: It includes three spatial dimensions plus a temporal dimension that captures contrast enhancement patterns over time. The scan acquires multiple series of images at different time points after contrast administration.
    
2. **Imaging protocol**: Typically involves:
    
    - Non-contrast phase
    - Arterial phase (25-30 seconds after contrast)
    - Venous phase (45-60 seconds after contrast)
    - Delayed phase (sometimes included)
3. **Advantages**:
    
    - Higher sensitivity (70-92%) compared to ultrasound or sestamibi scans
    - Better spatial resolution allowing detection of small adenomas (as small as 4mm)
    - Ability to distinguish parathyroid tissue from lymph nodes and thyroid nodules
    - Detailed anatomical information for surgical planning
    - Especially useful for ectopic parathyroid glands and multiglandular disease
4. **Limitations**:
    
    - Higher radiation dose than ultrasound or sestamibi
    - Requires iodinated contrast (contraindicated in some patients)
    - Higher cost
    - Requires specialized radiological expertise for interpretation
