what shoud I
how should I 
where should I
or shoud I at all?

knowing many things
knowing many ways
having many things
searching for some more

letting go everything
starting new
start from zero
be your own hero















context:

confused as to how i should proceed at the middle of Academic session
learing lots of new things that I might incorporate
how is the problem
i think filling the present moment and trust that all will workout somehow
may be a scoreboard of the virtues and habits daily is the way to go
