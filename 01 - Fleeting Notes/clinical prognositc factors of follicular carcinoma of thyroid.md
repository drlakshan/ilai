Age (>55 = higher stage/mortality)
Gender (Male sex possibly more aggressive)
Tumor Size (>4 cm high risk)
Extrathyroidal Extension (T4, worsens prognosis)
Distant Metastases (Grave prognostic sign, common via hematogenous spread)
Lymph Node Metastases (Uncommon, except Hürthle cell variant)
RAI Avidity (RAI-refractory disease = worse prognosis)
Completeness of Resection (R1/R2 residual tumor = poor prognosis)
