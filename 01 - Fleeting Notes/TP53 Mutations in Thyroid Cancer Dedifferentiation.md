# What Did I learn?


TP53 mutation as hallmark of thyroid cancer transformation to aggressive phenotypes.

#### Mutation Pattern by Subtype
• **PTC/FTC**: Virtually absent in pure differentiated forms
• **PDTC**: Acquired during dedifferentiation process
• **ATC**: Nearly universal presence (~95%)

#### Prognostic Significance
• Marks transformation toward anaplastic carcinoma
• Dramatically worsens prognosis when acquired
• Defines aggressive disease biology
• Associated with treatment resistance

#### Clinical Implications
• Dedifferentiation marker in surveillance
• Therapeutic target development focus
• Combination with TERT mutations: extremely lethal
• Loss of differentiated cancer therapies effectiveness
