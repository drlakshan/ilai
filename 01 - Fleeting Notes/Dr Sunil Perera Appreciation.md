Dear Sir

Every once in a while,
a great surgeon appears. 
In addition to highly skilled hands, 
would own a kind heart and a caring soul.


It was you Sir, for me.
the manner you treated me 
gave me an example
how an ideal surgeon should be.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart
for all you have done. 
Not only for me,
but for the entire humanity. 

Only way I see fit
to repay the debt
would be to serve others to best of my ability 
for which I have made a determination
All thanks to you!

Wish you best of health and prosperity
for many many years to come !

Here's a rewritten version of your poem: Claude

**Dear Sir**

Once in a while, a great surgeon appears,
Who possesses not just skill in their hands, 
But also a kind heart and a caring soul. 
It was you, Sir, for me.

The manner in which you treated me 
Provided a living example 
Of how an ideal surgeon should be. 
Your expertise, matched with compassion, 
Made all the difference in my healing.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart 
For all you have done— 
Not only for me, But for all of humanity.

The only way I see fit 
To repay this debt 
Is to serve others to the best of my ability, 
A determination I have now made,
All thanks to you.

I wish you the best of health and prosperity 
For many, many years to come.

Theruwan Saranai!
