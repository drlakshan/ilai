Cogan's syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the eyes and inner ears, which can also affect blood vessels. The diagnosis is primarily based on clinical symptoms as there is no single definitive test. [^1], [^2]

Key factors in diagnosis include:
*   **Ocular Inflammation** Symptoms include red, painful, or light-sensitive eyes, and blurred vision. A key sign in "classic" Cogan's syndrome is interstitial keratitis (inflammation of the cornea). [^3], [^4]
*   **Vestibulo-auditory Symptoms** This involves inner ear issues, presenting as hearing loss (which can be sudden and permanent), vertigo (dizziness), and poor balance. [^5], [^4]
*   **Exclusion of Other Diseases** Diagnosis requires ruling out other conditions with similar symptoms, most notably syphilis. Therefore, nonreactive serological tests for syphilis are a necessary component of the diagnostic process. [^6], [^3]
