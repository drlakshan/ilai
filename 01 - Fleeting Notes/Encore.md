# Reference

"Encore" is a French word that has been adopted into English and has several related meanings:

1. Most commonly, it refers to an additional performance or repeat of a performance that comes after the scheduled end of a concert, show, or other entertainment, usually in response to audience demand (e.g., "The band played two encores after their main set").

2. As an exclamation, it's used by audiences to request such an additional performance ("Encore! Encore!").

3. In a broader sense, it can mean "again" or "once more," especially in the context of performances or entertainment.

The word comes from the French "encore," which literally means "still" or "again." In French-speaking countries, ironically, they typically use the word "bis" rather than "encore" to request additional performances.
