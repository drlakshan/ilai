### **Key Wisdom from Marc Cormier’s TEDx Talk on Peak Performance Mindset**

#### **1. Success is More Than Outcomes (Winning)**  
- Society often equates success with trophies, medals, or visible achievements, but this is a narrow view.  
- **Wisdom:** True success is the culmination of countless small, often invisible actions—not just the "flashy" end result.  

#### **2. The Three Layers of Success**  
Cormier breaks success into three interconnected layers:  
- **Outcomes** (e.g., winning a race, landing a job).  
- **Performance** (personal growth, skill mastery).  
- **Process** (daily habits, fundamentals, consistency).  
- **Wisdom:** Obsessing over outcomes (e.g., winning) is unstable. Focus on *process* and *performance* to sustainably achieve outcomes.  

#### **3. Process > Performance > Outcomes**  
- The "three little pigs" metaphor: The pig who built a brick-by-brick foundation (process) outlasted the others.  
- **Wisdom:** Peak performance comes from valuing the mundane—sleep, nutrition, practice, resilience—not just the "big moment."  

#### **4. Balance is Key**  
- A healthy mindset balances all three layers:  
  - **Process** (e.g., studying daily).  
  - **Performance** (e.g., improving exam scores).  
  - **Outcomes** (e.g., passing the test).  
- **Wisdom:** Ignoring outcomes entirely is unrealistic, but overemphasizing them leads to stress and burnout.  

#### **5. Resilience Through Process**  
- Setbacks (injuries, rejections) are inevitable. Those who focus on process:  
  - See failures as stepping stones, not roadblocks.  
  - Maintain motivation and mental well-being.  
- **Wisdom:** Mastery is a long game. Trust the work, and results will follow.  

#### **6. The Iceberg Principle**  
- What you see (the performance) is just the tip; the real work happens beneath the surface (practice, discipline, recovery).  
- **Wisdom:** "Overnight success" is a myth. Greatness is built in the unseen hours.  

### **Final Takeaway**  
**"Embrace the process, trust the work, find balance, and let the results speak for themselves."**  
Peak performance isn’t about one heroic moment—it’s about stacking small, intentional actions over time.
