# Note

1. Heterophile antibodies
	1. Paul Bunnel  - Sheep RBC
	2. Monospot  - Horse RBC


2. EBV Specific antibodies
	1. Viral Capsid Antigen antibodies ( anti VCA IgM and IgG)
	2. EBV Nuclear Antigen ( denotes latency)
	3. Early Antigen ( acute phase only)
	4. EBV DNA qualification with PCR ( those developing lymphoproliferative disorder secondary to EBV)


# Context:

EBV infection induces specific antibodies and non specific heterophile antibodies that reacts with unrelated antigens eg Rabbit RBC Horse RBC 


I got a patient with fever and lymphadenopathy and EBV was suspected. Specific antibodies were negative : apparently early in the disease it can be negative
Can repeat later

Clinical picture with  Paul Bunnel (Sheep) or Mono Spot (horse)  is confirmatory
