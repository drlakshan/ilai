> > Tolosa Hunt syndrome (THS) is a common cause of orbital apex syndrome. It presents with painful and limited eye movements and although the exact cause remains unknown, it’s believed to be due to an abnormal autoimmune response and granulomatous inflammation affecting the orbital apex and/ or cavernous sinus.21 The workup of a case with suspected THS should include a complete white blood count and distribution, cerebrospinal fluid examination for cytology and microbiological workup, and MRI Brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast which has typical findings. CT reviews of the orbit can also help to identify the structures involved.

1. painful eye
2. cranial nerve involvement just like [[orbital apex syndrome]] but NO visual loss
3. abnormal immune response
4. septae in the cavernous sinus
