this the concept where there is an alteration in nasal microbiome (disbiosis) and epthelial integrity causing TH2 response related rhinitis


# reference

**The Role of Epithelial Barrier Dysfunction and Dysbiosis in the Pathogenesis of Chronic Rhinitis and its Link to Asthma directly addresses this. It states, "This review explores emerging evidence on how impaired nasal epithelial barrier integrity and alterations in the nasal microbiome (dysbiosis) contribute to chronic rhinitis phenotypes... These local changes are increasingly linked to similar processes in the lower airways, suggesting shared mechanisms in the united airway disease concept."
