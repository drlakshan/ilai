### Key Connections

The central theme—**"those who use AI replacing those who don't"**—connects strongly with:

1. **The medical AI story** which emphasizes AI as an amplifying partner rather than replacement
2. **Personal AI journey** showing how embracing AI creates opportunities rather than threats
3. **Healthcare AI applications** demonstrating how AI enhances rather than replaces medical professionals
4. **Philosophical discussions** about AI's true impact on human capabilities and meaning

The radiologist example (Geoff Hinton's 2016 prediction vs. 2025 reality) perfectly illustrates the pattern identified across multiple notes: **AI augments rather than replaces human expertise**.
