# What Did I learn?

1. reduce oedema and inflammation
2. Methylprednisolone or (prednisolone)
3. 1mg/kg tapered over 2 weeks
4. ENT UK 60mg/d for 5 days






# Context:


The management of Delayed Post-Traumatic Facial Palsy (DP-TFP) is fundamentally driven by a **Conservative (Medical) Management Protocol**, within which **High-Dose Corticosteroid Therapy** serves as the essential initial intervention.

### Context of Conservative Management

The conservative approach is the established default treatment for all patients presenting with DP-TFP. This preference is rooted in the unique pathophysiology of delayed palsy: the functional failure is typically caused by a **secondary, progressive injury mechanism**—specifically **inflammation and edema**—leading to compression and nerve ischemia within the rigid facial canal. Because the nerve structure is often largely preserved (neuropraxia or mild axonotmesis), this secondary damage is considered potentially reversible.

The intrinsic prognosis for DP-TFP is highly favorable, with studies showing conservative protocols resulting in extremely high success rates; in some series, 81.81% of conservatively treated patients recovered to House-Brackmann (HB) Grade I or II function. Conservative management is strongly favored when the onset is delayed, the palsy is incomplete, and Electroneurography (ENoG) demonstrates partial degeneration (less than 90% loss or greater than 10% response).

### Pharmacological Regimens: High-Dose Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of the pharmacological intervention for DP-TFP.

#### Rationale and Mechanism

The primary goal of corticosteroid therapy is to **reduce the edema and inflammation** that is driving the compression within the facial canal. By maximizing the anti-inflammatory effect during the critical initial window, clinicians aim to halt the progression of secondary nerve damage before permanent axonal loss occurs. The sources note that this rationale underlies the evidence-based preference for aggressive steroid therapy in the initial management of DP-TFP.

#### Drugs and Dosage Protocols

An **aggressive steroid therapy regimen is required**. **Methylprednisolone** is typically cited as the drug of choice, although **prednisolone** is also commonly used in protocols.

The sources detail several representative protocols for high-dose treatment:

1. **General High-Dose Regimen:** A representative protocol involves a high initial dose, such as **1 mg/kg/day**, administered and then **tapered off within two weeks** after commencement.
2. **ENT-UK Option:** A pragmatic option cited in the guidelines is **prednisolone 60 mg daily for 5 days** for delayed-onset traumatic palsy.
3. **Study Regimen (Prolonged Course):** An alternative regimen, supported by a prospective cohort study focusing on complete traumatic palsy with undisplaced fractures, suggests **prednisolone ~1 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks** with a subsequent taper.

#### Evidence and Clinical Outcomes

While the evidence for steroid use specifically in trauma is sometimes noted as **limited** or **weak**, the efficacy of the conservative approach, centered on steroids, is reflected in the high recovery rates observed.

Crucially, a prospective cohort study challenged the dogma of early decompression by treating patients with complete palsy and undisplaced longitudinal temporal bone fractures (even those with "unfavorable" ENoG results, defined as less than 5% response) **non-surgically with steroids alone**. In this specific group, 27 out of 28 patients recovered to HB Grade I or II by approximately 40 weeks. Patients should be counseled that recovery typically begins slowly, often showing the first clinical improvement around **8–12 weeks** post-injury.

#### Exclusion of Antivirals

Antiviral agents, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir, are standard for infectious etiologies (like Bell's palsy or Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome) but their role is **not substantiated for isolated traumatic palsy**. Trauma-specific guidelines do not recommend routine antivirals unless a concomitant viral etiology is suspected.

### Corticosteroids as the Initial Filter

The initial administration of aggressive steroid therapy is part of the comprehensive protocol for DP-TFP. This pharmacological step functions as a **"functional filter"**. Only patients who objectively fail this initial medical trial—meaning they show critical progression of nerve damage confirmed by ENoG demonstrating greater than 90% degeneration—should proceed to the complexity and risks associated with surgical facial nerve decompression.

What is the single most critical determinant of prognosis and management in facial paralysis following head trauma?::The timing of onset (immediate vs. delayed). (Source: [[scratchpaper]])
<!--SR:!2025-10-28,3,250-->

Delayed Post-Traumatic Facial Palsy (DP-TFP) is defined by an onset of facial weakness that is ==not immediate==, typically appearing ≥72 hours after the injury. (Source: [[scratchpaper]])
<!--SR:!2025-10-28,3,250-->

What is the underlying mechanism of Delayed Post-Traumatic Facial Palsy (DP-TFP)?
?
The palsy is caused by a **secondary injury** from edema, hematoma, or vascular compression within the rigid facial canal, not by a primary nerve transection. This implies the nerve was functionally intact immediately post-injury. (Source: [[scratchpaper]])

Delayed onset facial palsy carries a significantly ==better== prognosis than immediate, complete palsy. (Source: [[scratchpaper]])

The primary pathophysiological mechanism in DP-TFP is nerve ==compression== within the facial canal, leading to ischemia and subsequent neuropraxia or axonotmesis. (Source: [[scratchpaper]])

What is the gold standard imaging modality to evaluate a patient with post-traumatic facial palsy?::A High-Resolution CT (HRCT) of the temporal bones to map the fracture line and assess facial canal involvement. (Source: [[scratchpaper]])

What is the purpose of Electroneurography (ENoG) in managing DP-TFP?::It objectively measures the percentage of axonal degeneration by comparing the electrical response of the facial muscles on the affected side to the healthy side. (Source: [[scratchpaper]])
<!--SR:!2025-10-28,3,250-->

When is the critical time window to perform an ENoG for accurate results?::Between **3 and 14 days** after the *onset of paralysis*. Performing it earlier may yield falsely reassuring results as Wallerian degeneration has not completed. (Source: [[scratchpaper]])

What is the most important, non-negotiable priority in the supportive care of a patient with facial palsy?::Immediate and thorough **ocular protection** (artificial tears, ointment, taping the eyelid) to prevent corneal drying and ulceration. (Source: [[scratchpaper]])
