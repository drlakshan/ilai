Finally, we explore the future of work itself in chapter 8. Specifically, as human-machine collaborations become increasingly prevalent, companies will need to hire for and develop eight new “fusion skills”: intelligent interrogation (knowing how best to ask an AI agent questions, across levels of abstraction, to get the insights you need), bot-based empowerment (collaborating with intelligent agents to punch above your weight at work), reciprocal apprenticing (teaching AI agents new skills while also undergoing on-the-job training to work well within AI-enhanced processes), holistic melding (developing mental models of AI agents that improve collaborative outcomes), rehumanizing time (reimagining business processes to amplify the time available for distinctly human tasks and learning), responsible normalizing (shaping the purpose and perception of human-machine collaborations as it relates to individuals, businesses, and society), judgment integration (choosing a course of action amid machine uncertainty), and relentless reimagining (thinking of novel ways to overhaul work, processes, and business models to obtain exponential increases in improvement).
