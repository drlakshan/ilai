there are two steps involved in zettlekasten note taking
1. quick capture 
2. creating permanent notes
	1. in this step following feature are salient
		1. title which is descriptive [[Building ground up processing the fleeting notes is the key for Zettlekasten]]
		2. links
		3. tags
		4. and content which is succinct 


once that is done when we query the knowledge, I need to be able to get the information contained in a logical method

The ways that I have used to search include
search using obsidian search
Omnisearch
Powersearch
Local graph
Global Graph

There was something lacking. 
I think the missing piece is dataview.

e.g use cases (contains function)
[[use of contain() within dataview query to get a list of notes that are relevant]]
