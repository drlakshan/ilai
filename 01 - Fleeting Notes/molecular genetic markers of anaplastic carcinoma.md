# What Did I learn?



BRAFV600E (Actionable target, targeted therapy improves prognosis)
RAS Mutations (Indicates follicular pathway origin, no targeted therapy)
TP53 Mutation (Defining feature of ATC, dysfunctional p53 pathway)
TERT Promoter Mutation (Expected in ATC, high rate)
CTNNB1 Mutations (Common in ATC)
High Mutation Burden (Potential for immunotherapy)
