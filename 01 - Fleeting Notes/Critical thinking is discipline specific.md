# What Did I learn?


Critical thinking skills are discipline specific
dependant on the knowledge domain







# Context:

# The Discipline-Specific Nature of Critical Thinking

Complex cognitive skills, including critical thinking and problem-solving, are not generic, transferable abilities. They are highly dependent on the specific knowledge domain in which they are applied. Training someone to think critically in one field (e.g., history) does not confer the ability to think critically in a domain where they lack background knowledge (e.g., mathematics or surgery).

This is why clinical reasoning cannot be taught in a vacuum. It must be developed within the rich, specific context of medical knowledge. Without a deep knowledge base in a specialty, "critical thinking" is an empty exercise.

*   Complex cognitive skills are domain-specific.
*   There is no "generic" critical thinking skill that transfers automatically between unrelated subjects.
*   Lack of specific knowledge makes complex skills an exclusive domain of a privileged few.
