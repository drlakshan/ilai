I have the option of changing to live in on320 from Edmonton
Reasons: so many facilities
easy access 
quality construction

but if I do that we need to get some income source ? rental of Edmonton instead on on320 
this system will not change my reservoirs

if I buy another apartment by selling Edmonton, it might reduce the the reservoir significantly but income generation from AIrBNB will remain and we will have an updated lifestyle 

I think thats the way forward


Had a chat with Hashan, apparently the going rate for on320 3 bed is 65M and he can try to sell Edmonton one around 55M, then there will be a gap of 10M only.  Its a viable proposition. 

Factors that are important to consider are 
a. current issues of sewerage disposal and other issues such as non payments of management fees and  utilities by residents affecting us. 
is it ok to sell knowingly?

counter argument is that every apartment complex of this calibre will have some problems. and the buyer will buy with the knowledge of that.
