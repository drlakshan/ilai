Note 3: Fudosin - Cultivating an Immovable Mind

Fudosin, or "immovable mind," is the development of a calm and focused spirit that remains unshaken by challenges, distractions, criticism, or failure. This mental strength is built by repeatedly choosing to continue and practice, separating emotions from actions, and carrying one through the long journey to mastery.
