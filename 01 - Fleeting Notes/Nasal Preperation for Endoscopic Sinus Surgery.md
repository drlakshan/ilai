###### References

“Before surgery, two neurosurgical cottonoid pads with naphazoline f or each nostril are applied. At the beginning of surgery, a 2% lidocaine solution with 1:80,000 epinephrine is used for sub-mucopericondrial infiltration in septal procedures, for sub-mucoperiostal infiltration before turbinoplasty and for lateral nasal wall block during endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). This solution is avoided in patients with a cardiac history and in the very young or elderly subjects.” ([Cassano et al., 2010, p. 179](zotero://select/library/items/P8Z7Q5PT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NXIKLY2H?page=2&annotation=XURU2XH8))
