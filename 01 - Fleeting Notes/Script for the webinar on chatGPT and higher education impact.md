Thank you for the opportunity since I have only 15 minutes let me go straight to the topic.

I will have to tell you the story about me as that will explain why I am here  and what I might tell be relevant for you all as teachers (after all I am Ear Nose Throat Surgeon by profession). I have a keen passion on IT, I have had formal training in web technologies like PHP and MySQL from UCSC and Linux system administration, I had a brief stint in FOSS and have developed and maintained a handful of websites. Presently I administer the health.lk website. So while I would certainly not know the binaries of the LLM but I sure do have a firm understanding on use cases and am upto date with the new developments of the field. 

When I got to know  the news that the company OpenAI has released chatGPT back in November last year, I got really interested. Futhermore the Obsidian community - obsdian by the way a digital note making platform and personal knowlege managment system, had a vibrant discussion over this. By December I was quite convinced that this is  going to be one of the greatest disruptive technologies ever, similar in proportion to the development of the internet it self or the development of Gutenberg letterpress printing or as its widely referred to as an Iphone moment. I spoke to the head of the department Prof Madawa Chandrathilaka and wanted to initiate a discussion on chatGPT and its implications to teachers, students and the interaction between the two.

I told him and any one and everyone who came on my way that we have to stop everything we do and attend to do this. Last time I made a similar statement was when at the height of the war we had here where when the armed forces were engaged in a isolated battle while rest of the country was having musical shows. It needed firm and uniform resolve to stop the lunacy. I believe this tool has far reaching implications and use cases and its only the pre-emptive actions  will save the future of education - and dare I say - future of humanity it self (literally). 

so here we are today, and I am glad that we are initiating some form of discussion on the topic.

As an introduction let me summarise and distill what prof expounded about Large Language Models. They are fed with world's knowledge available on the internet, and based on the patterns, will predict and generate next set of characters and words. Thats all it does. However with the amount training it had gone through, the out put created is very fascinating. Its magical and you may even think that it has a mind of its own - although it doesn't. 

This has expanded to include beyond text and language manipulations to image creation, video creation and voice synthesis. 

I dont like the term Artificial intelligence. It implies sentience, reasoning, and ability to appreciate environment (consciousness) and emotions which are not actual qualities these models have. Better term may be text-based language processing models. (by the way chatGPT agrees with this)

However, the abilities demonstrated by these models in various aspects of life is quite mind boggling. These astounding, jaw-dropping and mind blowing features creates a false perception that there is another being living with you. 

so with these capabilities and advantages that these technologies whatever can go wrong? right? Previous speakers spoke in detail about the positives and mentioned briefly negatives, I on the other hand would like to focus more on the negatives. 

Please do not get me wrong. I am all for new technologies. Its just that I see a great threat/opportunity/confusion with this disruptive technology in mammoth proportions. 

I am literally going to play the role of devils advocate. This is practice where an official appointed by the church it self to arague against the canonization of a saint. that official does not necessarily hold the beliefs firmly and on the contrary be believing the oppoisite. However the process of performing the ritual promotes strength of argiumanes, explores alternatve perspectives, and test the vaidity and robustness of an idea or position.


Lets take the today's topic - education. The word education stands for imparting knowledge atttitude and skills transferred from a teacher to a student in its simplest form. In higher education I believe its all about creating an individual - self directed learner, who will have critical thinking skills and creative enough to manage resource availble to bettermet of the self and others.

Cognition and metacognition

When you and if you take the cognitive component away from the learner and hand it over to a different form animate or innanimate you are defeating the very purpose of education. If a learner use this alien intelligence to write essays, thesis and dissertaions for them without putting the necessary cognitive input, they are cheating themselves. When you outline your talk with the help of ai, arent you a, copying the thinking pattern of the AI and b, losing your authenticity that makes you you?

Writing Skill

We see a mushrooming of "quality writings" from students thus for have not been successful in their writing efforts. So as teachers how would we know that this intellectual work is the students and student alone and B how can help this student to achieve their full potential if they cover their efforts by a sugar coating of the artificial intelligence? Do we actually have methods or instruments that can realiably detect ai written material? Its an arms race between ai systems and counter systems which I think is futile. (insert cambrige professors idea of letting the students use ai)

Lastly writing is thinking. and thinking is the most important skill a human can aquire. and as any skill, we should be able to improve thinking/ and writing. The moment you delegate that to an external service you lose the very core of education.

Trust

This leads to another important binder of our society - trust. Organisations, institutions including educational, government and families every unit where two or more individuals are involved there should be trust for proper functioning of this unit. 
With the introduction of these technologies trust is challanged at many fronts. 
A. How do we know whatever we see is the " real thing"
(insert TED talk)
there is the concept of fake news and deep fakes

B. How do we know we are not manipulated?
C. How do we know  polarisations, cult formations and brain washing is not happenning by simple conversations that we do wtih the machines? Information bias, fake news spreading
D. How do we know what the student gives as the answer is their own 
E How do we know the teacher is taking the due dilligence on the student
F How can be sure that the teacher is not cut and pasting the answerscript to the chatbot and get a grading. If you dont see any problem with it let me highlight the teacher's personal feedback that is so important to the development of the learner

And then comes the analogy of counterfeit money and content creted by ai.

Intimacy

The currency in the ai in intimacy according to Yuval Noah Harari, as opposed to the attention in social media. when you develop intimacy with the bot, what happens to the lively teacher-student bond? bonding, critical social skills and collaboration.


Accuracy - story of hallucinations
we know about the problem of inaccuracies and hallucinations these LLM s known to produce. How do we know the accuracy is an important quesion. yes you can check the accuracy of the facts by doing your own research, however who will practically do it and if you can do it you might as well do it in the first place. What I see is that there is always tendency to lean towards least effort in the fastest way. Rather in and out without processing. This is what educators we need to be concerned about. We need to give the access and set of tools and skills to the students to use these responsibly at the same time we need to make sure the student will do these things with some cognitive processing happening on their part. 


Inequality

Rich richer Poor poorer


There are other overarching concerns about the existential threat to the humanity as we know it. See Geoffry Hintons work and Yuval Noah Harari's comments and the open letter written to halt further developments until some guardrails, regulations and codes of conduct are clearly laid down. 

The recent call for a six-month “AI pause”—in the form of an online letter demanding a temporary [artificial intelligence](https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/) moratorium—has elicited concern among IEEE members and the larger technology world. 

The [open letter, titled “Pause Giant AI Experiments,”](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/) was organized by the nonprofit [Future of Life Institute](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/future-of-life-institute) and signed by more than 27,565 people (as of 8 May). It calls for cessation of research on “all AI systems more powerful than [GPT-4](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gpt-4).”


“AI can be manipulated by a programmer to achieve objectives contrary to moral, ethical, and political standards of a healthy society,” says IEEE Fellow [Duncan Steel](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/people/faculty/dst.html), a professor of electrical engineering, computer science, and physics at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), in Ann Arbor. “I would like to see an unbiased group without personal or commercial agendas to create a set of standards that has to be followed by all users and providers of AI.”

IEEE Senior Life Member [Stephen Deiss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-deiss-33476b3)—a retired neuromorphic engineer from the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/)—says he signed the letter because the AI industry is “unfettered and unregulated.”

“This technology is as important as the coming of electricity or the Net,” Deiss says. “There are too many ways these systems could be abused. They are being freely distributed, and there is no review or regulation in place to prevent harm.”


 in discussing this topic let me quote few authorities 


[[1. People confuse performance with competence]]
2. New currency in intimacy
3. Counterfeit currency and our content
4. Trust is the key ingredient
5. I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.

	1.  With limited tools, [single-minded](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/single-minded "single-minded") people apply them inappropriately or indiscriminately.
	2.  If a person is familiar with a certain, single subject, or has with them a certain, single instrument, they may have a [confirmation bias](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/confirmation_bias "confirmation bias") to believe that it is the answer to/involved in everything.
