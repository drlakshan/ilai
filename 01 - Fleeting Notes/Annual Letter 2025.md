What a wornderful year 
there were health concerns and I managed to fix my self and use the break to improve myself [[things I learnt during cervical relaxation]]
I rested without breaking my practice
had a wonderful start spending Punya Kaalaya at Sri Maha Bodhi

I built up my practice slowly to see around 70 patients a day on clinic days, Monday, Tuesday,  Thursday, Saturday and did 7 cases per surgery day

I created a wonderful AI team and made Nawaloka the best and the first AI driven hospital in Sri Lanka

Multiple research publications 10 in total via NHREF 

had timeboxing deeply routed in to my calendar and lived an INTENTIONAL life.
