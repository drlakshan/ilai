# Alan Watts Quote: Embracing Change

> "The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance."
> — **Alan Watts**

## Core Philosophy
Change is inevitable and resisting it creates suffering. True wisdom lies in accepting impermanence, flowing with circumstances, and embracing transformation rather than fighting it.
