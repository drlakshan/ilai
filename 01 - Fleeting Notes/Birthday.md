turing 48
blessings of people
"big" and "small"
loved by all


passing moment 
no doubt
but a beginng nonetheless

new specs
new pen
new shoes
with new attitude of learning
lets move on
















context:

turned 48 today
getting recovered from a RTI actually COVID 19
recovering and recalibrating
need to win the world within
