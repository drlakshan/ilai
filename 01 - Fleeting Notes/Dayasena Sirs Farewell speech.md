Good evening everyone. 

  

My dear teachers, colleagues and friends,

  

It's a great privilege to be given the opportunity to talk about a legend in the field of ENT in Sri Lanka

  

A rare privilege a student gets. 

  

Thank you very much for this.

  

I am supposed to say a few words in honor of Dr RP Dayasena - my mentor.

  

Who is a mentor? Definition of a mentor is an experienced and a trusted advisor. Dayasena Sir epitomizes the term Mentor.

  

When preparing for this talk, I thought about how I should make it, I mean the process, the content and the delivery.

  

I was not very sure how it should be because this gathering is an unusual, informal one. However I was very sure what it should not be like.

  

I didn't want it to sound like another fellowship induction nor of course I didn't want to sound like an eulogy. 

  
  

So like a scientific man with an inclination to scientific method, I got on to good old research methodology protocol.

  

PICO question

What qualities of Dr Dayasena that would be important

  

Then I needed a sample. Fortunately for me there was a  Whatsapp Group created for this purpose. Sample size 48. perfect. Adequate number in the sample to increase the power of the study and validity of conclusions

  

Research instrument a whatsapp message

Data collection done on WhatsApp

Although the answers were useful it wasn't enough to perform any statistical analysis.

  

I will come to the responses towards the end of my talk.

  
  
  

I searched for ideal qualities of a teacher and came up with this: 

  

"In five ways, young householder, do teachers thus ministered to as the **South** by their pupils, show their compassion:

  

(i) they train them in the best discipline,

(ii) they see that they grasp their lessons well,

(iii) they instruct them in the arts and sciences,

(iv) they introduce them to their friends and associates,

(v) they provide for their safety in every quarter.

  

මේ කරුණු පසින් අතවැස්සා විසින් උපස්ථාන කරණ ලද්දාවූ දකුණු දිශාවවූ ගුරුවරු කරුණු පසකින් අතවැසියාට (ගෝලයාට) අනුකම්පා කරත්.

යහපත් කොට හික්මවත්,

හොඳින් උගන්වත්,

(තමන් දත්) සියලු ශිල්පශාස්ත්‍ර හා ධර්මය මනාව කියා දෙන්නාහු වෙත්.

මිත්‍රජනයා අතරෙහි කියා පෙන්වාදෙත්,

දිශාවන්හි ආරක්ෂාව ඇතිකෙරෙත්,

So Discipline comes first and we all know how he venerated discipline. Discipline is the foundation. Without which, how skillful or knowledgeable you are makes no meaning. He identified this and inculcated that deep into his trainees.

  

Teaching and training par excellence, we were blessed to be under your tutelage.

  

He did not keep anything behind and made sure he taught us everything he knew

He introduced us to his colleagues and friends and with that we could get different perspectives of the patient's care. A good example is the Pathology Slides discussions we used to do in collaboration with pathologists. Another would be skull base work with neurosurgeons. He of course pioneered skull base work in Sri Lanka.

  

When a problem comes, and they will come, especially when you are a trainee, less experienced and all, he will protect you and make sure you are guided and helped.

That's what is probably meant in the last virtue.

  

So it's clear that he ticked the boxes with perfect 10/10.

  
  

My dear Sir - you are a great teacher, mentor and an inspiration.

  
  

We would like to appreciate how your teaching, training and leading by example encouraged us to become who we are today.

  

We appreciate your hard working nature, and unfailing commitment to service.

  

Your teamwork has earned you respect not only in the ENT field but among other specialities and the general public.

  

We also admire your courage to call a spade a spade and take action when there is an injustice. This was very evident when various grievances came up in relation to professional practice as doctors. 

  

We are thankful to the way you looked after us the trainees who were going through rather difficult time not only because of academic work but concomitant family problems/difficulties

  
  

Speaking of Family if you want to see an ideal family, look nowhere else. He is a successful   father with the help of a dearly and dedicated wife who raised a beautiful and cherished family. His sons have done marvelously well in their academic careers.

  

With the skilled hands he healed many and added to that is his soothing voice that calmed burning hearts.

  

He sings Victor Ratnayaka so well the singing words reverberate in our minds.

  

Literally Hadawatha Dalu Selewe

  
  

Remember my experiment with research oriented appreciation of your virtues? Although I could not perform any statistical analysis the responses gave me an insight into virtues of Dr Dayasena in the eyes of trainees.

  

These were the words that best describes you

  

A gentleman

A gentleman who follows principles

Discipline Duty and Fairness

Legend Role Model

Excellent Clinician

Punctuality

Excellent Mentor

No one will be able to replace him

and did a great work without a big show!

  

Its Summed up with this

  

4 Ds

Duty

Dignity

Discipline

Dayasena

  
  
  

So let me conclude by saying we your students are deeply indebted to you for all the right things done for us. We have a part of our life shaped by your influence for sure.

  

As Steve Job Once said

"My job is not to be easy on people. My job is to take these great people we have and to push them and make them even better." _—_ _Steve Jobs_

  

That's exactly what you did!

  

I would like to wish on behalf of all your trainees all the very best and health. May your life's dreams come true and we eagerly await rather selfishly that your years of wisdom will still be a guiding light for our practice in the future too.

  

Thank you

  

To SIr with lovelife's dreams come true and we eagerly await rather selfishly that your years of wisdom will still be a guidling light for our practice in the future too. 

Thank you

To SIr with love


Set of questions:


1. What would you have become if not an ENT Surgeon?
2. What is your best professional achivement?
3. Do you have any regrets about your professional carrier choices?
4. How would you like us to remember you?
5.  If you were asked to give one advice to juniors what would that be?
