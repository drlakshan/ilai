# Note


In ABR click or tone bursts are delivered
in ASSR sinusoidal continous stimulation is delivered


Less time as multiple frequencies can be delivered.

Theoritical possibility of eliminating subjectivity of interpretaion of peaks on graphs and  better statistical analsying of reponses but studies have not conclusively proved neither corelation or superiority over ABR





# Context:


Learning new born hearing assesment and this quesiton of comparing ABR and ASSR came to being. CK was used to search.

An attractive but less studied alternative to the ABR is auditory steady-state response (ASSR) testing. ASSR delivers continuous sinusoids rather than tone bursts, as in the diagnostic ABR. ASSR may provide some advantages over ABR in that a statistical algorithm determines whether a response is present. Thus, most of the subjectivity needed for conventional methods of reading waveforms elicited from broad-spectrum click or tone-burst stimuli is removed. It also allows delivery of simultaneous frequencies, potentially decreasing the time required for testing. Recent studies comparing ASSR with ABR, however, have reported varying results. A 2016 study by Celik et al. demonstrated moderate threshold correlation between ASSR and ABR, whereas previous studies have shown a stronger correlation. Data validating ASSR for bone conduction specifically are also limited, but they may be useful in patients with conductive hearing loss between 0.5 and 4 kHz. At this point ASSR is not recommended as an alternative to ABR, but it may serve as a complementary test.
