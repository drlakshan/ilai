It has come. AI, ChatGPT, Bing Copilot,Midjourney etc etc. 
These things are making an impact the way I interact with the internet.

How can I get the AI to take my life forward from here?

Lets get clear what I should not use it for.
1. Write my articles : writing is thinking, Writing makes things clearer and clarity makes great decision. If I hand over it to AI I will be dumber. 
2. Do the entrire research: Becuase it hallucinates and how do I know the summary it created is the correct one?
3. Create notes for my obsidian vault : Obsidian is my second brain. it will be orginally mine and I want to have a collection that I created. However this knowledge creation process can be enhanced using AI. 
see the following example
[[example of how chatGPT can  read something and tabulate]]
this is on the way to create knowlege and I can do that without paying so its a win win situation. Basically feeding the LLM with what you want and getting the stuff in a digestible form is a healthy and productive way to improve your knowlege


reading fed parts of articles, text book excerpts etc can be used give me a digested stand point. use smaller amounts of text so that it want go beyond the capacity. 

Book summaries : this is a good way to improve myself


Another way I can use is to grade my work and get feedback. I can write a prose and ask it to grade it and give me feedback.
