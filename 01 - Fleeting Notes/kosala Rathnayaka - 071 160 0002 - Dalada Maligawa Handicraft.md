I got a message from Visakha (Nimal Siripala's Secretary) about a patient 
Incidentally I had multiple inbound communications about this patient Susil Premjayanth via Perashmi Mom 
He is a such a nice man who was worried. He had a mass attached to the left vocal cord and needed surgery. I was able to do that very professionally and more importantly REASSURINGLY. Apparently he is very connected. Even Maithreepala Sirisena Former President called me. I created a link and that will take me close to Lord Buddha. I will happily walk in the Dhamma Mawatha. Lets practice mindfulness and walk along the Dhamma Magga
