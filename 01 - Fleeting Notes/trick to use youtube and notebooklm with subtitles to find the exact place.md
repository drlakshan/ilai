1. download the youtube transcript with time stamps using GLASP
2. feed both the youtube video and the transcript to NotebookLM
3. generate the mind map
4. then click on the concept you want to explore WITH ONLY THE TRANSCRIPT FILE SELECTED (without the youtube link)
5. then you will be directed to the correct place in the youtube video


this way we can reduce the time used watching
increase the time engaging with the content
at the end of the day we can create notes for future self as well
