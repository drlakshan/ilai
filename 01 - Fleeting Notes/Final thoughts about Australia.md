Life is short. Need to look after those who will benefit from my work and existence. I have a reasonable income as per now. Chances of it becoming zero is remote and although there might be a drop, its unlike to be very low that I cannot sustain. 
There is also a high possibility of increasing the revenue from the practice as the competition is leaving and gettin weak. 
What I will gain from migrating is order, standardized living, may be a higher income but that will not give me fulfilment. 
Lets lead a meaningful life. Gracefully decline the offer(s). wrecked




Then this happend. Met Dr Himashi Kularatne who asked to take the opportunity. Points he made are as follows:

1. good happens to good people. How things work out in the world is mysterious and beyond reasoning. Letting go of the opportunities presented may be detrimental in the long run.
2. Australia is a great if not the greatest in the Education field for kids
3. Work stress may actually be less than here as there is switch off period
