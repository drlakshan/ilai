parasympathetic flow via the pterygopalatine ganglion
when stimulated : casues vasodilation and release of neuropeptides


Superior Salivatory ganglion --> Greater Petrosal nerve of the facial nerve -->pterygopalatine ganglion --> branches of the maxillary nerve supplies the nasal lining (palate and lacrimal gland)



sympathetic flow from the cervical chain : casues vasoconstriction
