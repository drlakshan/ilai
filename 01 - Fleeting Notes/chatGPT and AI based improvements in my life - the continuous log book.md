# Note



ChatGPT is here. With the power it has, I plan to improve my professional life with it (and other such ai tools)

1. English.  https://hadarshemesh.com/magazine/chatgpt-for-learning-english/
2. patient communications
	Follow up emails
	standard operative procedures
3. Proudly mention that this is not chatGPT generated text
4. I have tried to use as a coach in medical topics and I totally don't want that to happen as it is full of mistakes. see Denkers and Pharyngeal pouch discussions

Other new things

1. content generation for common ent conditions and repeated postings
2. consent forms updating 
3. improving appeal of the website

Things have changed - a lot. above discussions about medical conditions are very accurate now. It will only become better (principle 4 Ethan Mollick  [[four principles of using Ai according to co intelligence book]])

Now that I have a rough idea how the programming works and how I can do some programming myself, its time now to think about how I should take it from here. Its clear that things will move fast. and what is not so clear is how I should leverage it.
