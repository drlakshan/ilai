Always use Zotero to collect your references Do not save everywhere. Always in Zotero first
Eg if you want to use YouTube to get some wisdom use note book llm create stuff always reference that in Zotero keep whatever the notes you create saved there, Why you ask? Then you know always where these are if you want to search for detailed references. And B, you can drag the wisdom to obsidian using the Zotero integration and then create atomic notes with easy reference back. Local first with synchronization. Plain text. Open source, well sort of.

Let’s say you do you work on cursor, again you could do similar 
Let’s say you do your work in Perplexity Socratic tutor you can do the same.

Final knowledge always in Obsidian.
