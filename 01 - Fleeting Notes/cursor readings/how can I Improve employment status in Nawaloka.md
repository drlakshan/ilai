following is a great example how cursor and obsidian can work beautifully well.
what happend was as follows.
I found a great podcast on Harvard Business Review Ideacast on why emplyees quit [[Why Employees Quit HBR Article]]


Then I went to the website got the article, went to cursor, used fabric to summarise and created an extracted wisdom note.

Also I pbpasted the content in to a simple markdown file and used built in API based ai (claude sonnet in this instance) to interact and expand on the content. This is because fabric doesnt provide a method for iterative discussion of its outout.

However with the text I got I kept on creating markdown files. 
Then i reaslised its best to create them in a separate folder so that when I go back to obsidian I can interact with them specifically. 



from there I polished the content and created atomic notes that were moved to the permanent notes section in the classical zettlekasten way.

lastly I wanted create a cheat sheet of employment status improvement and I thought cursor would be the best place and it did a marvalouos job as evident in the content below.

Now I even can create a solid post from this. and since this is my own content I have curated over time, i hope the quality will be good.
