In a world searching for the gadget
latest and the greatest 
here I am going "backwards"
to my beloved pen and paper

Always helped me 
to bring the best of me
forgive me if I have deserted you 
which I really havent done. 

Phone my dear friend,
what you do is irreplacable.
but you have a definite place in my life now
like to swiss army knife 
to be taken out only when necessary
like a tool for the wise and experienced















context:

Progressively I am going back to the pen and paper and running awy from gadgets. 
I think that has made me to use the laptop more frequently and that in turn has made me more productive
