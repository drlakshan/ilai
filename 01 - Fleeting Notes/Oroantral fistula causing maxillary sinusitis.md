It is developed when the oroantral communication persists for more than 48 hours
and oral mucosa migrates to the nasal sinus casuing permanent epithelialization
this leads to spread of allergens and bacteria in to the sinus

“When an OAC fails to spontaneously close and persists for more than 48 hours, patients are at risk of developing an oroantral fistula (OAF). An OAF occurs as the migration of oral epithelium into the defect, resulting in a permanent epithelialized tract between the maxillary sinus and the oral cavity. The persistent communication allows allergens and bacteria to cause the inflammation of the schneiderian membrane, leading to the obstruction of the maxillary sinus ostia through which the fluid is drained into the middle meatus. The accumulation of stagnant sinus secretions in a hypoxic environment causes acute or chronic sinusitis. Iatrogenic causes account for 55.97%” ([Bhalla et al., 2021, p. 250](zotero://select/library/items/92JSESNN)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6VL6ZG97?page=2&annotation=52LKGV8A))
