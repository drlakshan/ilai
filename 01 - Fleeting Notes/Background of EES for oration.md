**II. Background and History**

In order to fully appreciate the significance of Endoscopic Ear Surgery, it's important to understand its evolution and historical context. 

A. Traditional methods of ear surgery

Traditionally, ear surgeries were performed using microscopic techniques. Introduced in the 1950s, this approach provided surgeons with a detailed view of the ear anatomy. However, this method was not without its limitations. It often required a large incision behind the ear, resulting in longer recovery times and discomfort for the patient. Moreover, the line of sight was often limited to direct views, making it difficult to visualize hidden or hard-to-reach areas of the ear.

B. Evolution and development of endoscopic ear surgery

The introduction of endoscopy in the late 20th century marked a significant turning point in the field of otolaryngology. Initially used for diagnostic purposes, endoscopes provided an expanded view of the ear anatomy, allowing for better visualization and access to the middle and inner ear. By the 1990s, driven by advancements in endoscope technology and the development of specialized instruments, surgeons began to perform therapeutic procedures using endoscopes. 

C. Key milestones and achievements in this field

The first endoscopic ear surgery was performed in the early 1990s, marking a significant milestone in this field. 


**Historical Landmarks in Endoscopic Ear Surgery**

- In the late 1980s to early 1990s, Nomura and Takahashi first reported transtympanic middle ear endoscopy, which was primarily used for diagnostic purposes.
- Poe and Bottrill utilized endoscopy to confirm perilymphatic fistula and identify other middle ear pathologic conditions.
- Thomassin used endoscopes to visualize residual cholesteatoma in the tympanic sinus and the retrotympanum.
- McKennan reported a second-look endoscopic inspection of mastoid cavities using a postauricular approach.
- Tarabichi described endoscopic ear surgery (EES) for cholesteatoma without using a microscope, and subsequently described other procedures including endoscopic tympanoplasty and stapedotomy.
- The works of Poe, Thomassin, and Tarabichi were pivotal in shaping the landscape of EES today.
- The International Working Group on Endoscopic Ear Surgery was created in 2007 to foster collaboration among otologists and further the development of EES. **[**1**]**

“Cohen et  al. presented a classification of the engagement of endoscope in otology and they classified that into three waves [19]. The first wave (Cohen class 1) was the diagnostic and documentation aspect of the endoscope like Poe and Bottrill work on use of the transtympanic endoscopy for the confirmation of perilymphatic fistula and the identification of other middle ear pathologic conditions [20]. The second wave (Cohen class 2) involved the use of the endoscope to assist in removal of disease, as an adjunct to the microscope like what Ayache et  al. performed in the management of cholesteatoma [21]. The third wave (Cohen class 3) involved the transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES) with the use of endoscope as the main workhorse for ear surgery that now had many applications in the field of otology and neurotology [4]. In the following paragraphs, we are going to present some of the main applications for TEES and how it has developed till being implicated in more advanced work” ([Moneir and Elkahwagi, 2022, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/TP8IBSQM)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UV3I7T7R?page=2&annotation=EKX5FLLY))

Since then, there have been numerous advancements, including the development of high-definition (HD) and 3D endoscopes, specialized endoscopic instruments, and advanced training methods for surgeons. These achievements have contributed to the increasing acceptance and popularity of endoscopic ear surgery across the globe.

In conclusion, the evolution of Endoscopic Ear Surgery has been a journey of continuous learning and advancement. It is a testament to the relentless pursuit of better, safer, and more efficient surgical methods in the field of otolaryngology.
