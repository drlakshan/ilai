# What Did I learn?

I have been experimenting. I want to learn. I want to use AI. Various ways of using AI I have tried. even inside Obsidian. Now with the experience I have over the years and years of teaching others. i have decided to follow the following process


1. When I want to THINK : start in the obsidian vault new blank note. ideally /scratch pad /Scratch paper 
2. think for yourself. (just the way I do now) Do not speak. Just Type. if you need write on paper before typing. but type
3. then the AI part comes. 
4. open up Cursor. 
5. fire up Gemini CLI 
6. use commands to the magic
7. once you are happy with the product return back to obsidian
8. then open up split view and make ATOMIC notes
9. and thats it. (may be create a way to do retrieval practice also)






## Gemini's gems

Of course. This is a strong, linear workflow that correctly separates your own thinking from AI-assisted processing. It's a solid foundation.

Here is my feedback on how you could enhance it, based on my capabilities and the principles of knowledge management:

### 1. Make the "Magic" in Step 6 More Specific
The phrase "use commands to the magic" is where the core AI interaction happens. To make this step more powerful and repeatable, I suggest defining a menu of specific "spells" or tasks.

**Instead of a general step, think of it as choosing a specific tool for a specific job.** For example, you could ask me to:
*   **Synthesize:** `"Synthesize these rough thoughts into a coherent summary."`
*   **Generate Questions:** `"Generate clarifying, connecting, and critical questions about this note."` (as per your instructions for me).
*   **Find Connections:** `"How do the ideas in this note connect to [[AI in medicine]] and [[Cognitive bias]]?"`
*   **Challenge Assumptions:** `"What is the weakest point or most significant assumption in this argument?"`
*   **Reformat:** `"Refactor this note for clarity by breaking down paragraphs and adding headings."`

### 2. Systematize the Creation of Atomic Notes in Step 8
This is the most critical step for building your knowledge base. To ensure your notes are truly "atomic," you could refine this step into a sub-checklist:

*   **One Idea Per Note:** Does the note capture a single, discrete idea?
*   **Write in Your Own Words:** Have you rephrased the AI-generated output into your own language? This is essential for retention and understanding.
*   **Title as an Assertion or Question:** Frame the note title as a clear statement (e.g., `[[AI can reduce diagnostic errors by synthesizing data]]`) or a question (`[[How can AI reduce diagnostic errors?]]`).
*   **Link Densely:** Have you connected the new note to at least 2-3 existing notes, tags, or concepts in your vault?

### 3. Elevate "Retrieval Practice" from "Maybe" to "Mandatory"
You correctly identify retrieval practice as a potential step, but it's arguably the most crucial for long-term learning. I would integrate it directly into the workflow.

**Implementation Ideas:**
*   **The Two-Note System:** When you create a permanent note, create a corresponding "Question" note. For example:
    *   Note 1: `[[AI can reduce diagnostic errors by synthesizing data]]`
    *   Note 2: `[[How can AI reduce diagnostic errors?]]` and link it back to the first note.
*   **Use a Spaced Repetition Plugin:** An Obsidian plugin (like `obsidian-spaced-repetition`) can automatically resurface these question notes for you to review.

### 4. Add a "Synthesis Loop"
The current workflow is linear (thought -> AI -> note). Great knowledge systems are cyclical. Consider adding a final, recurring step:

*   **Step 10 (Weekly/Monthly): Synthesize.**
    *   Review the new notes created in a given period.
    *   Ask me to `Summarize the key themes from these new notes: [[Note A]], [[Note B]], [[Note C]]`.
    *   This act of synthesis will help you form higher-level insights and create more robust, interconnected "Permanent Notes."
