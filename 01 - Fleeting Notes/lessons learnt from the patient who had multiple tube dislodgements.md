# Note

1. Adjustable flange tubes are not so strong 
2. shifting from the OT to the ICU, changing the position to take xrays etc in patients with very high BMI can cause tube dislodgement
3. Explicit instructions may be necessary to look after the tube in the ICU
4. Multidisciplinary team meetings are a useful way to iron out differences and make life easier
