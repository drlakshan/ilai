# What Did I learn?




Radioactive iodine uptake as therapeutic and prognostic factor.

#### Avidity by Subtype
• **PTC**: Generally high avidity, therapeutic benefit
• **FTC**: Variable avidity, treatment-responsive subset
• **Hürthle cell**: Reduced avidity, limits RAI effectiveness
• **MTC/ATC**: No avidity (different cell origin/differentiation)

#### Prognostic Implications
• High avidity = better treatment response = improved survival
• Loss of avidity = aggressive phenotype marker
• BRAF V600E mutation = reduced avidity
• Dedifferentiation = progressive avidity loss

#### Clinical Applications
• Post-surgical ablation therapy
• Metastatic disease treatment
• Surveillance whole-body scanning
• Treatment response assessment

#### Resistance Patterns
• BRAF-mutant tumors: Frequently RAI-refractory
• Aggressive variants: Early avidity loss
• Redifferentiation therapies: Restore uptake potential
