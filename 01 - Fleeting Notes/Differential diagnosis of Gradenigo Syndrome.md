“Differential diagnosis based on MRI characteristics alone includes neoplastic processes such as squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, or metastatic lesions. However, there is no elevation in erythrocyte sedimentation rate of C-reactive protein in these patients. Other lesions that may mimic PA on MRI include inflammatory pseudotumor, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis.” ([Gadre and Chole, 2018, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/34DL6QBS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D9PH7R7S?page=5&annotation=JZDU8UH8))
