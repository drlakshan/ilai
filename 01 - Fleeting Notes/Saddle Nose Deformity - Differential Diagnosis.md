# Saddle Nose Deformity - Differential Diagnosis

## Definition
Collapse of nasal bridge due to destruction of underlying cartilaginous/bony support

## Differential Diagnosis by Tissue Destroyed

### Cartilage AND Bone Destruction
**Syphilis (tertiary)**: Gumma formation
**Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**: Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation

#flashcards/rhinology 

what two differential diagnoses that cause BOTH bone and cartilage nasal structure destruction? :: 1. syphilis tertiary 2. GPA -Wegeners


### Predominantly Cartilage Destruction
**Leprosy**: Chronic granulomatous infiltration
**Relapsing Polychondritis**: Autoimmune cartilage destruction

### Variable Pattern
**Cocaine-Induced**: Ischemic necrosis
**Trauma**: Direct structural injury

## What Does NOT Typically Cause Saddle Nose
**Tuberculosis (sinonasal)**: Bony bridge usually spared
**Sarcoidosis**: Infiltrative, not destructive

## Diagnostic Workup
When encountering saddle nose deformity:
1. Detailed history (substance use, systemic symptoms, geography)
2. ANCA testing (GPA)
3. Treponemal tests (syphilis)
4. Biopsy of any active lesions
5. Assess for systemic involvement
