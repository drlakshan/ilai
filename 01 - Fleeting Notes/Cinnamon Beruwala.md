Took the family 
On Space
Need to reflect
As always 


Create notes from the lectures
Learn new things 
Get ready for 2024
With a freeze of tools

context

Its il Poya day. Was at Cinnamon Bay Beruwala. All in all relaxing but on the way car tyre went off due to some cut was it at the hotel? was it on the road that lead to the main road? dont know for sure. But the experience taught me a thing or two. 

got to know how helpful people can be. They helped us to find solutions to the problem. One got a inflatable power generated pump; one organised a nearby tyre mart. One offered us to stay inside their jewellery shop while mending is done. What worked was the 24 hour road side assistance from Colombo. That was really efficient. It worked well. With the experience I learnt, managed to compose myself not to fret about smaller things in life and progress in life.

in fact I did start my training, meditations and practice.
