The word educate is related to the Latin word eductus. And eductus means to “educe” or to “draw out” of a “person something potential or latent.” 6 In other words, education is supposed to help students develop and ripen what’s already within them. Most education systems do the opposite. There’s no drawing out. There’s only stuffing in—of knowledge and facts.
