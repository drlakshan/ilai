# What Did I learn?


#### High-Risk Variants
• Tall cell variant: Higher recurrence/mortality rates
• Columnar cell variant: Aggressive behavior pattern
• Hobnail variant: Associated with poor outcomes

#### Standard/Low-Risk Variants
• Classical PTC: Typically indolent course
• Encapsulated follicular variant: Generally favorable prognosis
• NIFTP: Essentially benign behavior (reclassified to avoid overtreatment)

#### Invasion Patterns
• Lymphovascular invasion: ≥4 foci = poor outcomes
• Positive surgical margins: High local recurrence risk
