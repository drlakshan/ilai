# Thyroidectomy Lecture Outline for Nurses (Updated)

### 1. The Thyroid Gland: What Nurses Need to Know
- **What it is:** An endocrine gland in the neck.
- **What it does:** Controls the body's metabolism (the "engine speed").
- **Key Hormones:**
    - **T3/T4:** Regulate heart rate, temperature, and energy levels.
    - **Calcitonin:** Helps regulate calcium.
- **The Neighbors (Parathyroid Glands):**
    - Four tiny glands behind the thyroid that are the main regulators of blood calcium.
    - **Clinical Pearl:** They are delicate and can be disturbed during surgery, which is why we monitor calcium levels so closely post-op.

### 2. Why is a Thyroidectomy Performed? (The "4 Cs")
- **Cancer:** To treat confirmed or suspected thyroid cancer.
- **Compression:** A large goiter is causing pressure on the trachea (difficulty breathing) or esophagus (difficulty swallowing).
- **Control:** To manage an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) when medication is not effective or tolerated.
- **Cosmesis:** The patient requests removal due to the goiter's appearance.

### 3. The Patient's Journey: Pre-Operative Nursing Care
- **Key Goal:** Ensure the patient is safe and prepared for surgery.
- **Nursing Responsibilities:**
    - **Patient Education:** Reinforce what to expect post-op (neck incision, potential for a drain, voice changes, neck stiffness).
    - **Baseline Assessments (Crucial for Post-Op Comparison):**
        - **Voice Quality:** Document their normal speaking voice.
        - **Swallowing:** Note any pre-existing dysphagia.
        - **Breathing:** Document any stridor or respiratory issues.
    - **Pre-Op Checklist:**
        - Confirm consent is signed.
        - Ensure all investigations are available (FNAC report, Ultrasound, TSH levels).
        - Confirm vocal cord check has been done and documented if required.

### 4. The Surgery: A Brief Overview
- **The Procedure:** Performed under general anaesthesia via an incision in a natural neck crease.
- **The Goal:** Safely remove the thyroid gland (either a lobe or the total gland).
- **The Priority:** Meticulously protect the surrounding structures:
    - **Recurrent Laryngeal Nerves (RLN):** Control the vocal cords.
    - **Superior Laryngeal Nerves (SLN):** Control voice pitch.
    - **Parathyroid Glands:** Control calcium.

### 5. Post-Operative Nursing Care: Your Most Important Role
- **Positioning:** **Semi-Fowler's position (30-45 degrees)** to reduce swelling and ease breathing.
- **The "Big 4" to Monitor Relentlessly:**
    1.  **Airway & Breathing:**
        - **Signs of trouble:** Stridor (high-pitched breathing sound), shortness of breath, use of accessory muscles.
        - **Causes:** Hematoma, laryngeal edema, bilateral vocal cord palsy.
    2.  **Bleeding & Hematoma:**
        - **Signs of trouble:** Visible neck swelling, patient complaining of a "choking" or "pressure" feeling, drain output suddenly increases.
        - **This is a surgical emergency.**
    3.  **Hypocalcemia (Low Calcium):**
        - **Signs of trouble:** Perioral numbness, tingling in fingers/toes, muscle cramps, anxiety. Check for Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs.
    4.  **Voice Changes:**
        - **Signs of trouble:** Any new hoarseness, breathiness, or difficulty speaking.

### 6. Early Recognition & Management of Complications
- **Hematoma:**
    - **Action:** **CALL FOR HELP IMMEDIATELY (SURGICAL REGISTRAR/CONSULTANT).** Sit the patient fully upright. Bring the emergency suture/clip removal kit to the bedside. Prepare for immediate decompression.
- **Airway Obstruction:**
    - **Action:** Sit patient upright, administer high-flow oxygen. **CALL ANAESTHETIST & SURGICAL TEAM.** Have emergency airway cart/tracheostomy tray ready.
- **Hypocalcemia:**
    - **Action:** Report symptoms and check bloods as per protocol. Administer oral or IV calcium as prescribed. Reassure the patient.
- **Vocal Cord Palsy:**
    - **Unilateral (RLN):** Hoarse/breathy voice. **Action:** Reassure patient, document, and inform the surgical team.
    - **Bilateral (RLN):** Stridor/airway obstruction. **Action:** Treat as an airway emergency.
    - **SLN Injury:** Subtle voice change (loss of high pitch). **Action:** Document and inform the team.
- **Scar:**
    - **Action:** Educate patient on long-term scar care (e.g., moisturising, sun protection).
