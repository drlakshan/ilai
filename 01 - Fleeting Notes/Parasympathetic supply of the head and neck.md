######  Note

CONTEXT:

In learning about the  [[First Bite Syndrome]] where there is hypothesised damage to sympathetic nervous system, and resultant supersentivity of the parasympathetic system causing initial bites to be painful, there was a need to recap the autonomic pathways of the head and neck.



[[autonomic innervation of salivary glands]]

other parts

Occulomotor
	Edingar Westphal
	Occulomotor cranial nerve via superior orbital fissure
	Cilliary ganglion located just behind the eye
	short cilliary nerve ( continuation of the nasocilliary nerve V1)--> cilliary muscle --> accommodation and iris sphincter muscle for pupillary constriction 



Facial
	Superior salivatory nucleus
	nervus intermedius
	geniculate ganglion
		*greater petrosal nerve*
		travels through the middle ear![[greater superficial petrosal nerve pathway.png]]
	combines with the deep petrosal nerve ( sympathetic fibres)
	and form the Vidian Nerve ( nerve of the pterygoid canal)
	pterygopalatine ganlgion
	V2
	Zygomatic division --> lacrimal nerve a branch of the opthalmic division of the V1 LACRIMAL GLAND ( although the vidian nerve is damaged during tran pterygoid approaches to the parasellar regions, there is no spontaneous blinking related reflex tearing however emotional tearig may be lost - AMW lecture on approach to sella and parasellar lesions **Basic and Extended Approaches to the Sella and Parasellar Skull Base**  
	Lead Presenter: Zara Patel, MD, Co-Presenter: Carol Yan, MD)
	Paltaine Nerves --> mucus glands of the palate
	nasoplatine nerves --> mucus membrane of the nose

*chorda tympani*
	secretomotor to submandibular and sublingual
	travel through the middle ear to join lingual nerve
	submandibular ganglion
	from there to submandibular and sublingual salivary gland

IX
	tympanic nerve
	tympanic plexus over the promontory
	lessor petrosal nerve
	foramen ovale
	![[image of the foramen ovale.png]]

otic ganglion
auriculotemporal nerve V3


Vagus (wandering nerve)
dorsal vagal nucleus
nucleus ambiguus
autonomic ganglion at C1
NO head and neck parasympathetic
goes to thorax and abdomen
