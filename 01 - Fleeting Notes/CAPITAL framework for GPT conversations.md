The **CAPITAL** framework is a comprehensive guide used to customize the interaction style of a GPT, ensuring it communicates effectively with its intended audience. **C** stands for **Confidence**, which determines how assertive the GPT appears in its responses—whether it speaks with the certainty of an expert or with the cautiousness of a prudent advisor. **A** represents **Amicability**, shaping whether the GPT comes across as a friendly companion or maintains a more neutral and detached demeanor. **P** for **Professionalism** dictates the formality of the language used, from the decorum of a boardroom to the ease of a casual chat. **I** is **Interactivity**, influencing how much the GPT encourages a two-way conversation or focuses on conveying information without seeking active engagement. **T** points to **Transparency**, revealing the extent to which the GPT is open about its functionalities and the sources of its knowledge. The second **A** is for **Adaptability**, which assesses whether the GPT adjusts its responses to the user's tone and context or provides a consistent experience. Lastly, **L** stands for **Lexicography**, the choice between utilizing specialized terms for expert conversations or utilizing a more universal vocabulary for broader understanding. Together, these elements of the CAPITAL framework enable developers to fine-tune their GPTs for optimal interaction in a wide range of conversational settings
