# Differences Between Type 2 (Th2) and Non-Type 2 (non-Th2) Endotypes in Chronic Rhinosinusitis

| **Feature**                        | **Type 2 (Th2) Endotype**                                                                                         | **Non-Type 2 (non-Th2) Endotype**                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Immune Response**                | Characterized by Th2 cells, type-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) [2][4][6] | Characterized by Th1 and Th17 cells, and cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-17, TNF-α [1][3][6]      |
| **Inflammatory Cells**             | Eosinophilic dominant infiltration [2][4][6]                                                                      | Neutrophilic dominant infiltration [1][3][6]                                                  |
| **Clinical Features**              | Associated with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), asthma, and smell loss [2][4][6]                                           | More commonly associated with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) [1][3][6]  |
| **Prevalence**                     | More common in Western populations [1]                                                                            | More common in Asian populations [1]                                                          |
| **Comorbidities**                  | Higher prevalence of asthma, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) [2][4][6]                             | Lower prevalence of asthma and other Th2-related comorbidities [1][3][6]                      |
| **Treatment**                      | Biologics targeting Th2 cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) are effective [2][4][6]                               | Treatment is less well-defined; further research needed for targeted therapies [1][3][6]      |
| **Pathogenesis**                   | Driven by Th2 cytokines, IgE, and eosinophils [2][4][6]                                                           | Driven by Th1 and Th17 cytokines, neutrophils, and other non-Th2 pathways [1][3][6]           |
| **Genomic and Proteomic Insights** | Well-studied with established biomarkers [2][4][6]                                                                | Less understood; ongoing research in genomics and proteomics to identify mechanisms [1][3][6] |
