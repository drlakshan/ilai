# What Did I learn?


refers to a concept of having a single value intelligence factor that governs performance across all cognitive tasks

[[Theory of Multiple Intelligences]]





# Context:
### 'g-Factor' (General Intelligence)
The 'g-factor' is the traditional psychometric concept that a single, underlying general intelligence factor governs performance across all cognitive tasks. Rooted in the work of Charles Spearman, this model observes that individuals who score well on one type of cognitive test tend to score well on others, suggesting a common mental capacity for reasoning and problem-solving. This view has heavily influenced the development of IQ tests, which primarily measure linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities and have historically defined the "academic" view of intelligence.
