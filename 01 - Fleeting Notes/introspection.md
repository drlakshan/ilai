Dullness and feeling of depression need be overcome 
will do that through this introspection
with the refuge of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha
will regain the flow and thrive

periodic overwhelmedness and sense of hopelessness comes causung lack of energy
with my introspection technique and helpful obsidian I am able to work through it.
