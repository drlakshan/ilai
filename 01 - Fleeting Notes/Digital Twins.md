A digital twin is computer generated simulation of a physical object. It can be an object, person, patient, physiological process etc. This can be useful for learning without risk of damage


# Reference


**Digital Twins**: A digital twin is a real-time, computer-generated replica of a physical object, patient, process, physiological system, or body organ. In healthcare, digital twins can simulate the human body or its parts, allowing medical professionals to analyze how different treatments might affect a patient. For surgical training, this means that surgeons can practice complex procedures on virtual patients before performing them on real ones. This technology not only enhances the precision and safety of surgeries but also allows for personalized surgery planning based on the specific anatomical and physiological characteristics of individual patients.
