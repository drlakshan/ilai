# Note


1. probe the caruncle to get an idea of the duct
2. use a hook to extract it
3. use a suture distally
4. palpate from outside
5. prevent damage to the lingual nerve by dividing tissue perpendicular or close to the duct not close to the gland (stay distal)
6. In gland excision place the incision low
7. Dissect on to the gland
8. Handle the posterior pole carefully, Reflecting the vein and the ligated artery upwards will protect the marginal mandibular nerve as well
9. May use nerve monitor
10. If the stone is not palpable when going externally, you may milk it down from the peroral side. may even explore from there
11. sialoendoscopy may be useful

“A probe or dilator is introduced into the caruncle under microscopic vision. The lower blade of a blunt-tipped scissors is inserted, and the overlying tissue is incised to the stone. Another techniquae is to incise the mucosa directly over the stone and spread the tissue apart to expose the duct, which is incised on the stone (Fig. 13.1).” ([Theissing et al., 2010, p. 302](zotero://select/library/items/UKFHJZ7B)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JKLM5WGI?page=317&annotation=PI8IAYY7))

“The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve can be directly identified and protected by facial nerve monitoring. This is safer than reflecting the nerve branch upward with the vascular stumps. The tissue above the ligated facial vein is explored with a stimulating electrode, and the nerve is identified and protected by spreading through the tissue in the direction that the nerve is expected to run. 

■ Indirect thermal injury is avoided by using only bipolar coagulation in proximity to neural structures.

■ The hypoglossal nerve is located below the gland and excretory duct. It is visible above the tendon of the digastric muscle. 

■ Stones from the hilar area may become displaced anteriorly into the duct during the dissection. In some cases they can be “milked” back into place, but otherwise the duct should be dissected further and, if necessary, resected through the oral cavity. 

■ Arterial vessels should be at least doubly ligated to prevent the slippage of ligatures. Suture ligation is preferred to prevent significant postoperative bleeding with risk of hematoma formation and laryngeal edema.” ([Theissing et al., 2010, p. 305](zotero://select/library/items/UKFHJZ7B)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JKLM5WGI?page=320&annotation=VCBMTPPY))
