# What Did I learn?


OAE/AABR screening ensures baseline hearing but cannot detect:
  - Delayed-onset hearing loss
  - Progressive sensorineural hearing loss
  - Post-natal acquired losses

  ## High-Risk Etiologies
  **Congenital CMV**: Frequently causes delayed/progressive loss despite
  passed screening

  ## Clinical Implication
  Ongoing audiological surveillance essential for at-risk infants (CMV,
  NICU graduates, family history).
