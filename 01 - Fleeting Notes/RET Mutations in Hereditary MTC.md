# What Did I learn?
Germline RET mutations determining MTC aggressiveness and prophylactic surgery timing.

#### ATA Risk Classification

| Risk Level | RET Mutation | Clinical Course | Surgery Timing |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Highest (HST) | M918T (MEN2B) | Very aggressive, infancy onset | Within first year |
| High (H) | C634 (MEN2A) | Aggressive, childhood onset | By age 5 |
| Moderate (MOD) | Codons 609,611 | Later onset, indolent | Age 10+ based on calcitonin |

#### Hereditary vs Sporadic
• Hereditary: Early detection via genetic screening = excellent prognosis
• Sporadic: Often advanced at presentation
• Somatic RET M918T: Independent predictor aggressive course

#### Prophylactic Management
• Genetic testing family members
• Calcitonin-guided surgery timing
• Curative potential with early intervention
