1. Arachidonic Acid Metabolism Disregulation
	1. 5LO 5-Lipooxygenase pathway increased activity
	2. LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 overproduction
	3. COX-1 pathway decreased activity
	4. PGE2 reduction usually an anti-inflammatory
2. Eosinophilic inflammation [[why is FENO elevated in Asthma]]
3. Mast cell activation
4. Aspirin sensitivity because of COX-1 further reducing PGE2 imbalance and worsening of effects of 5LO
5. Remodelling of respiratory tissues [[Nasal Polyps Aetiology Canvas.canvas|Nasal Polyps Aetiology Canvas]]

The pathophysiology of AERD involves:

1. Arachidonic Acid Metabolism Dysregulation:
   - Increased activity of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway
   - Overproduction of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes (LTs), especially LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4
   - Decreased activity of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) pathway
   - Reduced production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which normally has anti-inflammatory effects

2. Eosinophilic Inflammation:
   - Increased eosinophil infiltration in respiratory tissues
   - Elevated levels of eosinophil-activating cytokines (e.g., IL-5, IL-13)

3. Mast Cell Activation:
   - Increased numbers and activation of mast cells in respiratory mucosa
   - Enhanced release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, tryptase)

4. Aspirin/NSAID Sensitivity:
   - Inhibition of COX-1 by aspirin or NSAIDs further reduces PGE2 production
   - This leads to increased activation of the 5-LO pathway and leukotriene production
   - Results in acute respiratory symptoms upon NSAID exposure

5. Remodeling of Respiratory Tissues:
   - Chronic inflammation leads to structural changes in airways and sinuses
   - Formation of nasal polyps
   - Airway hyperresponsiveness
