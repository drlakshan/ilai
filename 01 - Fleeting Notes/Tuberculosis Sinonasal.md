# What Did I learn?

Sinonasal is almost always secondary to pulmonary TB
Bone spared


# Tuberculosis - Sinonasal Manifestations

## Etiology
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
**Key Fact**: Sinonasal involvement almost always secondary to pulmonary TB

## Clinical Presentation
- Chronic nasal obstruction
- Purulent or bloody rhinorrhea
- Extensive crusting
- Nodular thickenings or ulcerations
- Perforation of **cartilaginous** nasal septum

## Critical Anatomical Sparing
**Bony framework usually spared**
→ Saddle nose deformity is **NOT** a classic sign of sinonasal TB
(Contrast with leprosy, syphilis, GPA)

## Histopathology
- **Caseating** epithelioid granulomas
- Langhans giant cells
- Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli (may be sparse)
- Culture: gold standard but slow
- PCR: rapid alternative
