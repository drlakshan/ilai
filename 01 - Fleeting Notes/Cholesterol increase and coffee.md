“The concentration of the cholesterol-raising compound cafestol is high in unfiltered coffee such as French press, Turkish, or Scandinavian boiled coffee; intermediate in espresso and coffee made in a Moka pot; and negligible in dripfiltered, instant, and percolator coffee.13 In randomized trials, high consumption of unfiltered coffee (median, 6 cups per day) increased lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 17.8 mg per deciliter (0.46 mmol per liter), as compared with filtered coffee,52 predicting an estimated 11% higher risk of major cardiovascular events.53 In contrast, filtered coffee did not increase serum cholesterol levels.52 Thus, limiting consumption of unfiltered coffee and moderate consumption of espresso-based coffee may help control serum cholesterol levels.” ([Van Dam et al., 2020, p. 373](zotero://select/library/items/EC6QMH8A)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SGCX6IQQ?page=5&annotation=ECRNW9IK))
