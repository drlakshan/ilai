this is a feature I want to incoroporate in to Arogya
When a function is called demographic details will get extracted from certain cells and a template is populated and i will be taken to the template. That need to be in the patients file for future reference
Lets create a sheet template that will be copied in to the patient's file with the date appended. Then I fill the form and print out.
