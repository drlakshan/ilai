easiness and content
life flows gently
undisturbed by the rocks and pebbles
gracefully circumventing

way of thinking is the key
to face what life has to offer
think bold and act wisely
life will bring the best it can do

need to HEAL this experience
take one step at a time
to achieve and make myself useful
to me and others around












[[HEAL frame work of making learning stick]]
