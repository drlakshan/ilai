I think this is the best way forward for following reasons
1. I like API calls. there are limitations in the output and at the sametime there is room for customization as well. 
2. Cost will be less
3. can parallel get answers from diffrent models
4. MCP archtecture
5. abilty to interact with local AIs as well
6. offer of life time of access 
7. the cost is around 55K and for a lifetime AI use case may not be that of cost.
