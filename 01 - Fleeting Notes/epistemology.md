word:  epistemology



definition:

branch of philosophy about theory of knowledge(nature, origin and limits of human knowledge). what constitutes knowledge, how we acquire knowledge etc it teaches us how we form beliefs 


context:

there was video by Nick Milo on obsidian and AI use and I very happy to learn that he has come to conclusion that Claude code and Obsidian is the way forward for AI integration. Besides that one of the comments mentioned EPISTEMOLOGY. and the fact that video creator doesnt know about epistemology.
