[[Kalama Sutta]]


# Reference

The Kalama Sutra, a discourse attributed to the Buddha, provides a powerful framework for how individuals should approach and evaluate information before accepting it as truth. It emphasizes critical thinking, personal investigation, and the importance of direct experience, rather than blind faith or reliance on authority. It's not about becoming cynical or rejecting everything, but about developing a discerning and wise approach to accepting what is presented to you.

Here's how the Kalama Sutra guides a person in coming to accept anything given to them, broken down into key principles:

**The Core Message: Don't Accept Based On...**

The Buddha encountered the Kalamas, who were confused by the conflicting claims of various religious teachers. They asked him how they should discern truth. The Buddha's response outlined ten reasons why one should not accept something as true:

1. **Oral Tradition (anussava):** "Don't go by reports that have been handed down through many generations." Just because something has been said for a long time doesn't make it true.
    
2. **Lineage of Teachers (paramparā):** "Don't go by hearsay or tradition, just because it's been passed down through a lineage of teachers." The reputation of the teachers doesn't guarantee the truth of their teachings.
    
3. **Rumor or Hearsay (itikirā):** "Don't go by rumor or popular belief." What everyone is saying might not be accurate.
    
4. **Scriptural Authority (piṭaka-sampadāna):** "Don't go by the authority of religious texts alone." Even revered texts should be examined critically, as interpretations can vary and texts may contain inconsistencies or be context-dependent.
    
5. **Logical Reasoning (takkavitaraka):** "Don't go by mere logic or deductive reasoning." Logic can be flawed, based on incorrect premises, or lead to multiple equally valid but potentially incorrect conclusions.
    
6. **Inferential Reasoning (naya-hetu):** "Don't go by inference or speculation." Drawing conclusions based on assumptions might not lead to the truth.
    
7. **Reflecting on Reasons (ākāra-parivitakka):** "Don't go by reflecting on the reasons for something, thinking 'this seems reasonable'." What seems reasonable to you might not be universally true or accurate.
    
8. **Agreement with Preconceived Opinions (diṭṭhi-nijjhāna-khanti):** "Don't go by accepting a view after pondering it and finding that it fits with your pre-existing beliefs." Confirmation bias is a powerful force.
    
9. **Speaker's Ability (bhabbarūpatā):** "Don't go by the mere seeming competence of the speaker." A charismatic or eloquent speaker can be convincing even if their information is incorrect.
    
10. **"Our Teacher Said So" (samaṇo no garū):** "Don't go by the thought, 'This is our teacher,' simply out of respect for your teacher." Even respected teachers can be mistaken.
    

**The Guiding Principles: Accept Based On...**

After outlining what not to base acceptance on, the Buddha guides the Kalamas toward a more experiential and ethical approach. He encourages them to evaluate based on the consequences of a belief or action:

- **"When you know for yourselves that certain things are unwholesome (akusala), bad (savajja), censured by the wise (viññugarahita), and when put into practice, lead to harm and suffering (dukkha-vipāka) – then you should abandon them."** If a belief or action, when practiced, leads to negative consequences for yourself and others (like greed, hatred, delusion), it should be rejected.
    
- **"When you know for yourselves that certain things are wholesome (kusala), good (anavajja), praised by the wise (viññuppasattha), and when put into practice, lead to well-being and happiness (sukha-vipāka) – then you should accept and practice them."** Conversely, if a belief or action, when practiced, leads to positive consequences like kindness, compassion, and wisdom, it is worthy of acceptance and cultivation.
    

**Applying the Kalama Sutra to Accepting Information:**

So, how does this help someone accept information given to them? It's a process of careful evaluation, not immediate acceptance or rejection:

1. **Maintain Skepticism (but not cynicism):** Don't automatically believe everything you hear or read, regardless of the source. Question the information and the motivations behind it.
    
2. **Identify the Source:** Consider the origin of the information. Is it a reputable source? Does the source have any biases or agendas that might color the information?
    
3. **Seek Evidence:** Look for supporting evidence beyond just someone's word. Are there facts, data, or verifiable experiences that support the claim?
    
4. **Consider the Consequences:** Think about the potential outcomes of accepting and acting on this information. Will it lead to harm or benefit for yourself and others?
    
5. **Reflect on Your Own Experience:** Does this information resonate with your own understanding of the world and your own experiences? While personal experience isn't the sole basis for truth, it's a valuable factor to consider.
    
6. **Engage in Open Discussion:** Discuss the information with others who have different perspectives. This can help identify potential flaws or biases in your own understanding.
    
7. **Be Patient and Open to Revision:** Acceptance doesn't have to be immediate and absolute. You can tentatively accept information while continuing to investigate and be open to revising your understanding as new evidence emerges.
    

**Important Considerations:**

- **Balance:** The Kalama Sutra encourages critical thinking, not paralysis by analysis. Don't become so skeptical that you are unable to make decisions or form beliefs.
    
- **Context:** The Sutra emphasizes direct experience. Some things can only be understood through practice and personal engagement.
    
- **Humility:** Recognize that your own understanding is limited and that you are always learning. Be willing to admit when you are wrong.
    
- **Ethical Foundation:** The ultimate guiding principle is the impact on well-being. If something leads to harm and suffering, it should be questioned, regardless of its origin or apparent logic.
    

**In Summary:**

The Kalama Sutra provides a powerful antidote to blind faith and uncritical acceptance. It empowers individuals to become active seekers of truth, using their own intelligence and ethical compass to navigate the complex world of information. It's about developing a healthy skepticism, valuing evidence and experience, and ultimately choosing beliefs and actions that lead to well-being for oneself and others. It's not about rejecting everything, but about accepting what you find to be true and beneficial based on careful and thoughtful examination.
