“Using 15 blade or iris pointed scissors, dissect the anterior margin of the sternomastoid muscle superiorly, as far as the mastoid process. Expose the perichondrium of tragus and the anterior wall of the external auditory canal and connect the incisions. Dissect medially to the anterior border of the sternomastoid muscle until the posterior belly of the digastric muscle is identified. Dissect the loose connective tissue between the parotid gland and mastoid bone using a mosquito clip until you identify the tympano-mastoid suture. A small amount of fat separates the facial nerve from the mastoid bone. Using a mosquito clip, expose the facial nerve (32.4, 32.5).
