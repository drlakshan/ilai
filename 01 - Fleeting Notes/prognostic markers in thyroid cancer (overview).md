# Prognostic Markers in Thyroid Cancer (Overview)

This comprehensive briefing has been atomized into focused concept notes:

#### Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma
1. [[Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Prognostic Factors]] - Clinical and pathological determinants
2. [[PTC Histologic Variants and Risk]] - Aggressive vs indolent histological patterns
3. [[BRAF-TERT Mutation Synergy in Thyroid Cancer]] - Highest-risk molecular combination

#### Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma
4. [[Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma Invasion Patterns]] - Critical histopathologic determinant
5. [[Radioiodine Avidity and Thyroid Cancer Outcomes]] - Therapeutic and prognostic factor

#### Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
6. [[MTC Biochemical Marker Doubling Times]] - Dynamic survival predictors
7. [[RET Mutations in Hereditary MTC]] - Genetic risk stratification and prophylaxis

#### Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma
8. [[Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma BRAF-Targeted Therapy]] - Modern precision medicine approach
9. [[ATC Staging and Survival Outcomes]] - Sub-staging within Stage IV classification

#### Cross-Cutting Factors
10. [[Thyroid Cancer TNM Staging Principles]] - Universal staging framework
11. [[TP53 Mutations in Thyroid Cancer Dedifferentiation]] - Transformation marker
12. [[Thyroid Cancer Age-Related Prognostic Thresholds]] - Universal age-based risk factors

#### Executive Summary
Thyroid cancer prognosis depends on subtype-specific factors integrated through staging systems and molecular markers, with age, invasion patterns, and genetic alterations as key determinants across all subtypes.
