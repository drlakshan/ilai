Lets Start 

It’s the 50th tomorrow

No special preparations from my side. Don’t know about others. The biggest thing I did is I arranged a Dhamma desana of ududumbara kashyapa thero. I believe this is a great meritorious act. 

Had a chat with Dinith Indika Hegoda and thanked him for all the support given to me and also invoked merits. I thought I made him happy. 

Next couple of hours following aspects of life need to be thought of. (I don’t think I NEED to FINALIZE things nor do I think I HAVE to)

	as a side note I think as much as I miss the additional funcationalities afforded by a laptop in terms of more computing prowess and features, it is also a distraction.
