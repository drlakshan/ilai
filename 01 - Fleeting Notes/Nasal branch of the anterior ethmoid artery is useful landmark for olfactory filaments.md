# Note

When we make a flap at the nasal septal angle and elevate the mucosa down we can encounter an artery of about  1 mm diameter. This artery enters the cranial cavity from the nasal cavity. Its a branch of the anterior ethmoid artery. Advantage of identifying that is the  cribrifom plate and the olfactory filaments are close by.

# Context:

We need to be careful about the cribriform area in frontal sinus surgery. This land mark will help.
