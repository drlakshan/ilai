# What Did I learn?

#### Individual Mutations
• BRAF V600E (40-60% PTC): Modest recurrence increase alone (HR ~1.3)
• TERT promoter (10% PTC): Strong independent predictor poor outcomes
  - 10-year survival: ~66% vs ~98% wildtype

#### Synergistic Effect
BRAF V600E + TERT promoter mutations:
• HR for recurrence: ~6.6 (vs 1.3 BRAF alone)
• Markedly increased mortality rates
• Defines molecular high-risk category

#### Clinical Implications
• Guides aggressive treatment decisions
• Intensive surveillance protocols
• Potential targeted therapy considerations
