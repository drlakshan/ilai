The framework includes five levels of AGI, preceded by a Level 0 for non-AI systems. 
Level 0: No AI. This is the baseline, consisting of non-AI computing systems like calculators that simply follow programmed instructions.
Level 1: Emerging AGI. At this level, AI systems can perform specific tasks at a capability level comparable to or slightly better than an unskilled human. Some of the language models available today, like ChatGPT, can be classified as Level 1 for certain tasks.
Level 2: Competent AGI. An AI at this level performs on par with at least 50% of skilled adult humans in a given field. The performance is better than the median skilled professional.
Level 3: Expert AGI. This level describes AI systems that perform at the level of at least the 90th percentile of skilled adults, functioning as bona fide experts in their domain.
Level 4: Virtuoso AGI. A virtuoso-level AI system performs at the top 1% of skilled adults. This indicates a near-perfect or exceptional level of performance.
Level 5: Superhuman AGI. The highest level represents an AI that can outperform 100% of humans across a wide range of tasks, displaying intelligence beyond human capability.

# AGI Level 0: No AI

This is the baseline, consisting of non-AI computing systems like calculators that simply follow programmed instructions.

## Clinical Context and Significance
Understanding Level 0 provides a foundational contrast to AI systems. In medicine, many traditional tools and systems (e.g., basic calculators, electronic health record systems without intelligent features) operate at this level, executing predefined rules without learning or adaptation. This helps in appreciating the distinction between automation and true artificial intelligence.

## Key Points
*   Baseline for AGI framework.
*   Non-AI computing systems.
*   Follows programmed instructions only.
*   No learning or adaptation.

# AGI Level 1: Emerging AGI

At this level, AI systems can perform specific tasks at a capability level comparable to or slightly better than an unskilled human. Some of the language models available today, like ChatGPT, can be classified as Level 1 for certain tasks.

## Clinical Context and Significance
In healthcare, Level 1 AGI systems can assist with routine, well-defined tasks, such as transcribing medical notes, basic image recognition (e.g., identifying common anomalies in X-rays with human oversight), or answering simple patient queries. While useful, they require significant human supervision and validation.

## Key Points
*   Performs specific tasks.
*   Capability comparable to or slightly better than an unskilled human.
*   Examples: Some current large language models (e.g., ChatGPT for certain tasks).
*   Requires human oversight.

# AGI Level 2: Competent AGI

An AI at this level performs on par with at least 50% of skilled adult humans in a given field. The performance is better than the median skilled professional.

## Clinical Context and Significance
Level 2 AGI in medicine could significantly augment clinical workflows. Examples might include AI systems that can accurately interpret a majority of common radiological scans, assist in differential diagnosis for common conditions, or optimize treatment plans for standard cases, performing as well as a competent junior resident or a general practitioner in specific areas.

## Key Points
*   Performs on par with at least 50% of skilled adult humans.
*   Better than the median skilled professional.
*   Significant augmentation of human capabilities.

# AGI Level 3: Expert AGI

This level describes AI systems that perform at the level of at least the 90th percentile of skilled adults, functioning as bona fide experts in their domain.

## Clinical Context and Significance
An Expert AGI in medicine would be invaluable. Such systems could provide highly accurate second opinions on complex cases, identify subtle patterns in patient data that even experienced clinicians might miss, or guide intricate surgical procedures with expert-level precision. This level represents a true "expert-to-expert" interaction, aligning with Dr. Lakshan's persona.

## Key Points
*   Performs at the 90th percentile of skilled adults.
*   Functions as a bona fide expert in its domain.
*   Provides highly accurate and nuanced insights.

# AGI Level 4: Virtuoso AGI

A virtuoso-level AI system performs at the top 1% of skilled adults. This indicates a near-perfect or exceptional level of performance.

## Clinical Context and Significance
In a medical context, a Virtuoso AGI could revolutionize fields by consistently outperforming almost all human specialists. This might involve discovering new disease mechanisms from vast datasets, designing highly personalized and effective treatment regimens that are beyond human cognitive capacity, or performing surgical tasks with unparalleled precision and minimal invasiveness.

## Key Points
*   Performs at the top 1% of skilled adults.
*   Near-perfect or exceptional level of performance.
*   Revolutionary potential in specialized fields.

# AGI Level 5: Superhuman AGI

The highest level represents an AI that can outperform 100% of humans across a wide range of tasks, displaying intelligence beyond human capability.

## Clinical Context and Significance
A Superhuman AGI in medicine would fundamentally transform healthcare. It could solve currently intractable medical problems, accelerate drug discovery and development exponentially, and provide universally optimal healthcare solutions. This level implies an intelligence that not only masters existing medical knowledge but also generates new, profound insights beyond human comprehension.

## Key Points
*   Outperforms 100% of humans across a wide range of tasks.
*   Displays intelligence beyond human capability.
*   Solves currently intractable problems.
*   Generates new, profound insights.
