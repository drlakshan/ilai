#### History and etymology

Gradenigo syndrome was first described in 1907 by **Giuseppe Conte Gradenigo** (1859-1926), an Italian otolaryngologist 2,3.


In 1904, Professor G. Gradenigo of Turin, Italy (Fig 1), described a symptom complex that included paresis of the abducens nerve, severe pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, and acute suppurative otitis media.5” ([Gadre and Chole, 2018, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/34DL6QBS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D9PH7R7S?page=1&annotation=WEX4CWU4))
