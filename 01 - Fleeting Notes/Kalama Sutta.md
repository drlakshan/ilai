This gives a framework for me to analyze and act upon the claims the world put forwards 

1. Try to specify the claim and get to the crux of the argument. Use questions wisely  [[question refining pattern to improve a prompt]]
2. Reflect on your own. It doesn’t matter whether you know everything or not. Probably and most certainly you don’t know but thats fine . This process will get creativity, intuition, and invention developed 
3. If you think this is wholesome/ kusala that will help you and the world consider doing it
4. Think in universal terms 
5. Seek wise counsel but remember 2

 * Identify the claim: What is the specific belief or idea you're considering?
 * Question the source: Who is presenting this information? What are their motivations? Are they credible experts?
 * Examine the evidence: What evidence supports this claim? Is it reliable, verifiable, and sufficient?
 * Consider alternative explanations: Are there other possible explanations for the observed phenomena?
 * Assess the impact: How might accepting this claim affect you, others, and the world? Would it lead to positive or negative consequences?
