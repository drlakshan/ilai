I operated on a patient who underwent right thyroid lobectomy histo came back as follicular carcinoma with capsular invasion but no vascular invasion complete excision
the family wanted to avoid I131




######  Note

RAI recommended
1. All patients wiht gross extrathroid extension
2. >4cm
3. tumours with micrscopic extrathyroid extension
4. regional mets
5. other features can be consiered
	1. tall cell
	2. columnar
	3. insular
	4. PDTCs
	5. intrathyroid vascular invation
	6. gross or micrscopic multofocal  disease
7. if above is not present not indicated <1cm














###### References


Current ATA treatment guidelines recommend RAI ablation for all patients with gross extrathyroid extension of the tumor or known distant metastases regardless of tumor size. RAI can be considered for patients with a primary tumor greater than 4 cm in size, tumors with microscopic extrathyroidal extension, and regional metastases. RAI treatment decisions for these patients with intermediate to high risk of recurrence or death from thyroid cancer depend upon higher risk features, such as concerning histologic subtypes (e.g., tall cell, columnar, insular, and PDTCs), the presence of intrathryoid vascular invasion, and gross or microscopic multifocal disease. In the absence of high-risk features, RAI ablation is not recommended for patients with unifocal or multifocal cancer when the lesions are smaller than 1 cm.
