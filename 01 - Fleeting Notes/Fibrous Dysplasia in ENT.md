## Definition

- A rare, benign bone disorder where normal bone is replaced by fibrous tissue and immature bone.
- Results from a non-heritable mutation in the GNAS gene.
- Leads to bone expansion, deformity, pain, fractures, and functional impairment.

## Types

- **Monostotic:** Affects a single bone (70% of cases).
- **Polyostotic:** Affects multiple bones (20-30% of cases).
- **McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS):** Most severe form, with polyostotic FD, café-au-lait spots, and endocrinopathies.

## Craniofacial Fibrous Dysplasia (CFD)

- Common, occurring in >50% of polyostotic cases and 30% of monostotic cases.
- Zygomatic-maxillary complex is frequently affected in monostotic FD.
- Anterior cranial base is affected in >95% of polyostotic and MAS cases.

## ENT Manifestations

- **Facial Asymmetry and Deformity:** Slow-growing FD causes vertical dystopia, proptosis, frontal bossing, and jaw asymmetries.
- **Nasal Obstruction:** Abnormal bone growth can lead to nasal airway obstruction.
- **Jaw and Bite Misalignment:** Malocclusion can occur.
- **Vision Problems:** Optic nerve compression can cause visual disturbances.

## Temporal Bone Involvement

- Rare but significant.
- **Conductive Hearing Loss:** Most common symptom, due to external auditory canal stenosis, middle ear blockage, or Eustachian tube obstruction.
- **External Auditory Canal Stenosis:** Can lead to recurrent external otitis and secondary cholesteatoma.
- **Mass in the Temporal Area:** Swelling in the temporomastoid region.
- **Pain and Otorrhea.**
- **Sensorineural Hearing Loss:** Can occur if the internal auditory canal is narrowed.
- **Facial Nerve Involvement:** Extremely rare.

## Diagnosis

- **CT scans:** Study of choice, showing a characteristic "ground glass" appearance.
- **Biopsy:** May be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.

## Management

- **Observation:** For asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic patients.
- **Surgical Treatment:** Indicated for symptomatic cases to control pain, correct deformity, relieve stenosis, decompress nerves, or for biopsy.
- **Surgical Techniques:** Recontouring, resection with bone grafts, or minimally invasive approaches like Endoscopic Endonasal Approach (EEA).
