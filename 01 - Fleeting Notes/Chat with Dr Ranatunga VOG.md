Had a nice chat with him. We discussed issues of life and investments. What he told me was always be present for the family and also never miss an opportunity to be for your children specially tennis matches. Those are the things that he really regret now.

As far as the investments go apparently, it is at the apartment that he has bought at trillion residences that is given him the
Most return on investment. He also recommended to build a house. He also has some fixed deposits and I think the beer forward for me. Also would be to buy a couple of apartments that will bring money as a passive income.
