this is how it goes
I have a media in and media out
then nodes where things happen

Eg. a node may add a tranformation effect and with key frames defined I can use to limit the effect. 

What i need to know is the various types and how tos

1. how do I navigate between the compositions? how do I adjust them once done?
2. It looks like a lot complicated until I know at least most of the possibilities
