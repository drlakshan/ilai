Today I reflected upon my trajectory
How I became who I am 
From meager beginnings
To where I am today being privileged to serve patient s from all walks of life
From the business magnets magnets to politicians actors, famous sports people, so on, and so forth.

This is not bragging bragging, but contemplating and reflecting upon the path that I took
I am humbled and will strive to serve more
