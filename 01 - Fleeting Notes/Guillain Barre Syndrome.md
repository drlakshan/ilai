# Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)

## Core Concepts
**Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)** is an acute, immune-mediated polyneuropathy. The classic presentation is an ascending paralysis, often preceded by an infection (e.g., *Campylobacter jejuni*). The underlying mechanism is molecular mimicry, where antibodies targeting infectious agents cross-react with components of peripheral nerves (gangliosides), leading to demyelination and/or axonal damage.

A key diagnostic finding is **albuminocytologic dissociation** in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), characterized by elevated protein levels without a corresponding increase in white blood cells, typically seen after the first week.

## ENT Surgeon's Perspective & Clinical Pearls

As an ENT surgeon, involvement of the cranial nerves and airway are critical considerations. GBS can present with a variety of head and neck symptoms, making it an important differential diagnosis for many common ENT presentations.

### ENT Manifestations
- **Bilateral Facial Nerve Palsy (Facial Diplegia):** While unilateral Bell's palsy is common, the sudden onset of bilateral facial paralysis should raise immediate suspicion for GBS.
- **Bulbar Palsy:** Involvement of lower cranial nerves (IX, X, XII) can lead to:
    - **Dysphagia:** Difficulty swallowing, with risk of aspiration.
    - **Dysarthria:** Slurred speech.
    - **Dysphonia:** Hoarseness or breathy voice due to [[vocal cord structure]] paralysis.
- **Miller Fisher Syndrome:** A well-known triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, which can present to an ENT with complaints of dizziness or visual disturbances.

### Airway Management
This is a critical area where ENT expertise is vital.
- **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of respiratory status with Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Negative Inspiratory Force (NIF) is essential. A declining FVC is a strong indicator of impending respiratory failure.
- **Intervention:** Prophylactic intubation should be considered in cases of rapid progression, bulbar weakness with aspiration risk, or significant respiratory muscle weakness.
- **Tracheostomy:** If prolonged ventilation is anticipated, a planned tracheostomy is often necessary. See [[Avoiding and Managing Difficult Airway AMW 2022]].

### Differential Diagnosis in ENT
It's crucial to differentiate GBS from other conditions presenting with similar head and neck signs:
- **Myasthenia Gravis:** Fatigable weakness is a key differentiator.
- **Brainstem Stroke:** Will typically show corresponding findings on MRI.
- **Lyme Disease / Sarcoidosis:** Can also present with facial diplegia.
- **Functional Neurological Disorder:** As per my own clinical experience, a functional component should always be considered, especially with atypical presentations. I once had a patient admitted with earache where the initial diagnosis was GBS, but it was clearly a functional disorder.

## General Medicine Overview

### Symptoms
- Classically, **symmetrical ascending weakness** and sensory disturbances (paresthesia).
- Loss of deep tendon reflexes.
- Autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, blood pressure instability).

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Presentation:** The history and physical exam are paramount.
- **CSF Analysis:** Lumbar puncture for albuminocytologic dissociation.
- **Electrophysiology:** Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) will show demyelinating or axonal patterns.

### Treatment
- **Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg):** The most common treatment.
- **Plasmapheresis (Plasma Exchange):** Also effective, but more invasive.
- **Supportive Care:** Respiratory support, DVT prophylaxis, and management of autonomic dysfunction are the cornerstones of management. Steroids are not effective.
