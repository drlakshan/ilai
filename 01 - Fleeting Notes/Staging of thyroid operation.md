######  Note

CONTEXT:


Say we are doing a very difficult thyroidectomy and we are concerned that oneside is infiltrated by tumour, what we can do is to do the better side and check for nerve integrity
and if there is loss of signal, we can stage it.
if there is no loss of signal we can proceed to the the side of interest.


Similarly if the cancerous side is infiltrated and you have now cleared to the max and if you want to try a little bit more but a bit hesitant, you can go to the opposite side do that side and check for the nerve ingerity and come back.
