######  Note


Type 1 : Anterior ethmoidectomy 
cells ethmoidal and frontal if any removed
Its like balloon dilatation

“The successive approaches used to improve drainage of the frontal sinus include anterior ethmoidectomy, complete dissection of all anterior ethmoid and frontal cells within the frontal recess (also known as the Draf I procedure), widely opening the frontal ostium (Draf IIa), resection of the floor of the frontal sinus from the nasal septum medially to the lamina papyracea laterally (also known as the Draf IIb procedure), and connection of the two frontal sinuses from orbit to orbit with removal of each frontal sinus floor, inferior portion of the frontal intersinus septum, the superior part of the nasal septum (also known as the Draf III procedure, modified Lothrop, or transseptal frontal sinusotomy).” ([Scholes and Ramakrishnan, 2017, p. 193](zotero://select/library/items/88R6F8JA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/W4FU56YD?page=193&annotation=GGAG4TSX)) “
