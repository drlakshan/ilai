People confuse performance with competence" is often attributed to the American author and management consultant Warren Bennis. In his book, "On Becoming a Leader," Bennis writes:

> "People confuse performance with competence. They think that if someone can do something well, then they must be competent. But competence is more than just being able to do something. It's also about knowing why you're doing it and how to do it effectively. It's about having the knowledge, skills, and abilities to get the job done right."
