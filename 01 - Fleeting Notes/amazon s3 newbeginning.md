this part of the note I have entered after setting up the ipad and iphone app while they get synced around 1:52. if this shows up in ipad an iphone thats a good thing, I will do the same from them too


This part I typed from ipad

This part I am voice typing use in Obsidian app on my iPhone. Hopefully this will also get synced on to other vaults in other devices and if that happens really well we are in for a treat.
