“Neuroblockade of the iSLN has been previously described for the treatment of superior laryngeal nerve pain and as a useful adjunct for blocking the laryngeal adductor reflex in the management of challenging airway intubations in partially awake patients [12,13,16].” ([Bradley et al., 2020, p. 839](zotero://select/library/items/M64XUJWV)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PJGZNV3D?page=3&annotation=5G65YDMM))
