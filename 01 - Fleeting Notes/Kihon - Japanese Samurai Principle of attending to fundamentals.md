# What Did I learn?


For true mastery one has to master the fundamentals
remember Bruce Lee : I fear the one who has practiced a skill 1000 times not the one who has practiced 1000 skills ones - or to that end
we need to focus on simple things
continue to focus on basics







# Context:


Learning about mastery
