“Cawthorne-Cooksey exercise Firstly, a series of eye head co-ordination exercises were performed to promote gaze stability during both sitting and standing position. Secondly VOR training with subjects standing combining movements of an image across the retina with head movement. Thirdly upright balance retraining exercises that enhance the use of various sensory cues for gaining postural control and head and trunk movement or with eyes closed during standing and walking. Patients were warned they might feel little discomfort and little increase in their symptoms. Patients were instructed to repeat each component of exercise five times per session and three sessions per day.” ([Bhadouriya et al., 2021, p. 1752](zotero://select/library/items/FTLKJ5AZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NM6JYJQ4?page=3&annotation=RPGBDSXI))
