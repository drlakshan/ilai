# Note


1. go straight to the gland
2. elevate on the surface of the gland
3. use ligated facial vein to lift up the soft tissue superficial to it.
4. make sure the upper flap is not pressurised by the retractors
5. use skin hooks preferably 
6. be careful of the interior surface of the upper flap : the nerve may just be there.

# Context:

Saving of the marginal mandibular nerve has important functional and cosmetic advantages in the submandibular gland surgery.

Along with the two other nerves (hypoglossal and submandibular nerve) this is an imprtant consideration in salivary surgery.
