# What Did I learn?



context engineering is the strategy and prompt engineering is the tactic

prompt engineering
	Scope: Single request/response
	Timescale: Immediate
	Artifacts Optimized: Wording, Tone, Examples

context engineering
	Scope: Full session/workflow
	Timescale: Persistent, multi-turn
	Artifacts Optimized: Data selection, Memory, Tool schemas





# Context:

its pivotal that we give the full context and plan to get the best out of AI interactions. Previously I was concentrating on the prompt engineering. Now we need to think boarder.
