### Highlight 1. Uneducate > Page 26 · Location 313
The word educate is related to the Latin word eductus. And eductus means to “educe” or to “draw out” of a “person something potential or latent.” 6 In other words, education is supposed to help students develop and ripen what’s already within them. Most education systems do the opposite. There’s no drawing out. There’s only stuffing in—of knowledge and facts.

### Highlight 4. Spectacularly You > Page 90 · Location 1280

### Highlight 5. Discover Your Mission > Page 105 · Location 1510
Forget following your passion, which is far too difficult to figure out. Instead, follow your curiosity. What do you find interesting? Say yes to the tiny internal clues nagging you to learn more about botany, take welding classes, or pick up that sewing hobby you abandoned. The things that pique your curiosity aren’t random. They will point you to where you need to go. Unlike your appetite, indulging your curiosity will increase your curiosity. The more you follow the bread crumbs, the more they tend to appear.

Isaac Asimov didn’t hit the New York Times best-seller list until his 262nd book. 8 That’s not a typo. That’s 43 years writing 261 consecutive non-best-sellers.
### Highlight 5. Discover Your Mission > Page 112 · Location 1614
We want the external validation, the pat on the back—the gold medal. We let someone else determine whether we’re good enough. Once we get approval, life becomes a tightrope to not lose that approval.

“We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought,” as John F. Kennedy put it. 1 We
### Highlight 6. Unlock the Wisdom Within > Page 127 · Location 1851
We don’t think with a pen and paper. We “think” with Google.
### Highlight 6. Unlock the Wisdom Within > Page 129 · Location 1872
Let’s say you’re curious about where good ideas come from. Instead of jumping on Google right away, or even reading relevant books, think about the question first on your own. Search inside your own mind, mine it for relevant ideas, and jot them down. If you reverse the order—if you think after you read—other people’s opinions will exert too much gravitational pull on your own.
### Highlight 6. Unlock the Wisdom Within > Page 130 · Location 1888
Ideas, as the filmmaker David Lynch puts it, are like fish: “If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you’ve got to go deeper.”
### Highlight 6. Unlock the Wisdom Within > Page 135 · Location 1964
My high school soccer coach had a saying that I love: If you’re not in possession, get in position.
### Highlight 6. Unlock the Wisdom Within > Page 137 · Location 1999
You don’t need controlled substances to emulate Sagan’s approach to creativity. The key is to separate the idea generation phase from the idea evaluation phase—your evening self from your morning self.
### Highlight 6. Unlock the Wisdom Within > Page 139 · Location 2027
It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover.—HENRI POINCARÉ, SCIENCE AND METHOD
### Highlight 6. Unlock the Wisdom Within > Page 140 · Location 2038
“Your body knows what to do,” he reiterated. “Pull the trigger when you feel it’s the right moment—not when you think it is.”
### Highlight 6. Unlock the Wisdom Within > Page 143 · Location 2087
Here are some questions I ask in deciding who to allow into my inner circle: Is this person transparent? Do they enjoy diving deep to catch the bigger fish instead of remaining in shallow waters with small talk? Will they listen to what I say without judging me or shaming me? Will they share honest feedback intended to improve my work?
### Highlight 6. Unlock the Wisdom Within > Page 144 · Location 2099
“If I have seen further,” Newton famously wrote, “it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” 18
### Highlight 6. Unlock the Wisdom Within > Page 145 · Location 2118
“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool,” as Richard Feynman reminds us.
### Highlight 7. Unleash the Power of Play > Page 155 · Location 2261
So it’s not that you can play when the stakes are low. It’s that you must play when the stakes are high.
### Highlight 7. Unleash the Power of Play > Page 156 · Location 2285
Extraordinary thinkers pursue knowledge with no obvious utility. They explore for the sake of exploring. They calculate the rotation rate of wobbling plates, not knowing it might lead to a Nobel Prize one day.
### Highlight 7. Unleash the Power of Play > Page 158 · Location 2311
Play increases creativity in part because it reduces our fear of failure. Even if you fail—even if the Entourage episode you plotted sucks—nothing bad is going to happen. That feeling of safety can shut down the inner critic that often gets in the way of imagination.
### Highlight 7. Unleash the Power of Play > Page 158 · Location 2315
Think of these thought experiments as warm-ups before exercising. If you skip the warm-up and go right to running fast or lifting heavy, your body won’t perform at its best.
### Highlight 7. Unleash the Power of Play > Page 159 · Location 2331
The lesson is simple: Sometimes the best way to find a solution to your problem is to solve someone else’s—to drop The Office and pick up Entourage or to drop your guitar and pick up the mandolin.

Creating is more valuable than consuming.

We often want to be the noun (a songwriter) without doing the verb (writing songs).

Let me repeat that: What you don’t know can set you apart from others.
### Highlight 8. Dare to Create > Page 168 · Location 2453
As Kevin Kelly, founding executive editor of Wired, says, imagination is “the one skill in life that benefits from ignoring what everyone else knows.” 7
### Highlight 8. Dare to Create > Page 175 · Location 2560
So, yes, you will be misunderstood. They will attack you, insult you, and drag your good name through the mud. When that happens, do what Elizabeth Gilbert advises: “Just smile sweetly and suggest—as politely as you possibly can—that they go make their own fucking art.
### Highlight 8. Dare to Create > Page 175 · Location 2562
Then stubbornly continue making yours.” 17
### Highlight 8. Dare to Create > Page 176 · Location 2574
Internal fuel burns clean. It’s renewable. If you run out, you don’t need to turn to foreign sources to replenish it with more validation, more approval, and more likes. You have an infinite supply of it within.
### Highlight 8. Dare to Create > Page 176 · Location 2577
If you stick with it long enough, the trolls and the critics will move on. They’ll find someone else to sneer at. And your art will speak for itself.
### Highlight 8. Dare to Create > Page 177 · Location 2598
Michael Jordan made more last-minute baskets to win the game than any other NBA player in history. But he also missed the most last-minute baskets to lose the game.

Lionel Messi, one of the best soccer players of all time, says it took him “17 years and 114 days to become an overnight success.” 27

And we don’t all start from the same place. Privilege, opportunity, and luck combine to give some people a head start or a Mario Kart–type rocket boost.

“It’s never too late to be who you might have been,” as George Eliot purportedly said.
### Highlight 8. Dare to Create > Page 182 · Location 2673
So stop comparing yourself to other rockets that have already reached escape velocity. Focus on your own trajectory. Move up one inch. And then another. And then another. The higher you climb, the lighter things will feel.
PART IV: The Outer Journey
### Highlight 9. Detecting Bullshit > Page 189 · Location 2755
What author Jonathan Swift wrote in the 18th century still applies today: “Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after it.” 4
### Highlight 9. Detecting Bullshit > Page 195 · Location 2854
When scientists make statements, “the question is not whether it is true or false but rather how likely it is to be true or false,” as Richard Feynman explains. 17
### Highlight 9. Detecting Bullshit > Page 196 · Location 2878
As Upton Sinclair famously said, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” 22

### Highlight 9. Detecting Bullshit > Page 200 · Location 2938
Richard Feynman once received a letter from an undergraduate student who got an answer wrong on a physics exam. 31 Her answer was based on a statement she found in a textbook authored by Feynman, so she wrote a letter to him. Feynman wrote back admitting that he made a mistake: “I am not sure how I did it, but I goofed.” Then he added: “And you goofed, too, for believing me.”

As Timothy Leary purportedly said, “You are only as young as the last time you changed your mind.”
### Highlight 10. Look Where Others Don’t Look > Page 209 · Location 3056
Talent hits a target no one else can hit, but genius hits a target no one else can see, to paraphrase the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer.
### Highlight 10. Look Where Others Don’t Look > Page 211 · Location 3090
Some of the best minds of our generation spend most of their time ensuring that you keep watching, keep clicking, and keep refreshing.
### Highlight 10. Look Where Others Don’t Look > Page 216 · Location 3166
This is a mantra that Amazon’s Jeff Bezos lives by. “I very frequently get the question: ‘What’s going to change in the next 10 years?’” he observed. “I almost never get the question: ‘What’s not going to change in the next 10 years?’” 11 It makes more sense to invest in what’s not going to change—what people will still care about and will still use even 10 years from now.
### Highlight 10. Look Where Others Don’t Look > Page 217 · Location 3193
You’ve heard the term déjà vu—being in a strange place or circumstance yet feeling like it’s familiar, like you’ve been there before. There’s also the reverse, jamais vu—seeing something familiar but experiencing it in a new way.
### Highlight 10. Look Where Others Don’t Look > Page 217 · Location 3196
Jamais vu is key to creativity. Many original ideas come from looking backward for inspiration and finding the new in the old—from seeing something in a way that others haven’t.

Every time I return to a book, it’s a new person reading it.
### Highlight 11. I Am Not Your Guru > Page 226 · Location 3323
The famous productivity guru wastes an hour every day scrolling through social media. This doesn’t mean their advice is wrong. It means they’re human.

So instead of calling my room an office, I started calling it an idea lab. An idea lab is where innovative ideas are born. An idea lab involves experimentation. An idea lab is for daydreaming. I love my idea lab (and I hated my office).
