# Note

This is a technique to deliver high flow 70l/min FiO2 100% through nasal
Cavity



# Context:

In laryngeal surgery one of the biggest problems is that visual amputation of the surgical field by endotracheal intubation. 


One option we use to do was jet ventilation 

This is similar but delivered through nose

# Reference 

In THRIVE, oxygen is administered through a large nasal cannula at flow rates up to 70 L/min, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) up to 100%.[10](https://aao-hnsfjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oto2.125?campaign=woletoc#oto2125-bib-0010) THRIVE prolongs the apnoea period while reducing the risk of carbon dioxide (CO2) retention and barotrauma.[11](https://aao-hnsfjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oto2.125?campaign=woletoc#oto2125-bib-0011)THRIVE main advantage in laryngeal microsurgery is that it frees up the visual field of the operated site.[12](https://aao-hnsfjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oto2.125?campaign=woletoc#oto2125-bib-0012)
