Chole21 classified the petrous apex into an anterior petrous apex and posterior petrous apex, separated by a coronal plane passing through the internal auditory canal (Fig. 2). Jackler and Parker22 described differences between infections of the petrous apex that involved the mucosa-lined spaces (petrous apicitis) versus those that involve the bone and marrow (osteomyelitis). Each one could be acute or chronic.” ([Gadre and Chole, 2018, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/34DL6QBS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D9PH7R7S?page=2&annotation=Y9SCMQS6))
