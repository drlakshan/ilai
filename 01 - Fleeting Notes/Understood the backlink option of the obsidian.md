Obsidian links notes. 
There are two sorts one linked the other unlinked
Title of the note if word to word and in exact spelling is mentioned somewhere / in any where in the vault it will be displayed as an unlinked mention. So if it is multi worded chances are it might not.

See when I copied the Title of this note and pasted it on the Endoscopic Denker's, it appeared as a back link which is not mentioned. 
Simple change of the spelling or the number of words made it not visible on the back link section
