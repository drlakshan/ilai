# Note


B = MAP

Behaviour 
Motivation
Action
Prompt


# Context:

Was listening to a podcast on Think Fast Talk Smart with BJ Fogg

There are models that explain behaviour and there are methods
There are aspirations and outcomes all these have specific meanings
for eg. wanting to read more is an aspiration
reading 1 book a week is an outcome
actual reading a paragraph is a behaviour which is prompted by Motivation, Action and Prompt
