Septoplasty patient
bit psychiatric
tamed by gentle firmness
cared for with great results

entire family father mother and the daughter
gave prasies 
akin to gods
worshipped me giving me tears

















context:

this patient known / related to subhani harshani a vocalist, came from Tangalle after been told about me. They were a rather anxious family needing a lot of coaxing / cajoling. Bitter sweetness. any how they were really happy and said that I am a god and didnt want me to go to gods as they needed me! All three - father, mother and the daughter (patient) paid homage / paid court
