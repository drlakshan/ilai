# What Did I learn?

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma sub-staging within universal Stage IV classification.

#### Stage IV Sub-classification
• **Stage IVA (Intrathyroidal)**:
  - Rare (<10% cases)
  - Best outcomes: 1-year survival ~73%

• **Stage IVB (Extrathyroidal, No Distant Mets)**:
  - More common presentation
  - 1-year survival ~25%

• **Stage IVC (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - Most common (>50% cases)
  - Dismal prognosis: 1-year survival ~8%

#### Critical Prognostic Factors
• Complete resection (R0): Median survival 10-14 months vs 3-6 months incomplete
• Age <60-65: Better tolerance aggressive therapy
• Multimodal therapy: Surgery + high-dose radiation (≥50 Gy) + systemic therapy
