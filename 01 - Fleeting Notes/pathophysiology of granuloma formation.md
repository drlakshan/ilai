# What Did I learn?

cytokine driven process when phagocytes cannot eradicate an offending agent,
IFN gamma from Tcells
TNF alpha from macrophages
recruitment and transfiornation of macrophages in to epitheliod histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells. Langerhans giant cells that forms a nodular structure to wall off the inciting agent.

caseating granulamas : core of amorphous cheese-like necrotic debri resulting from macrophage death. strongly suggestive of infection particularly MTB

non caseating : pack of epitheliod cells without a central necrotic core. Hallmark of non-infectious inflammatory conditions like [[Sarcoidosis]]
