In humans there is cross modal stimulation visual, auditory, proprioceptory

a blind patient's auditory cortex develops vice versa

“Cross-Modal Interaction Among the Sensory Cortex In their natural environments, humans and animals receive multimodal sensory stimuli. The sensation of external stimuli in the environment is taken to the brain by specialized sensory organs such as the eyes, the ears, or the skin. These inputs are processed in primary sensory cortices, such as the primary auditory cortex, the primary somatosensory cortex, or the visual cortex. Anatomic connections suggest that there is a multimodal functional interaction among sensory cortical regions, which means that they all interact in the brain in order to acquire a faster perception of the external world and its stimuli. The deprivation of a sensory modality is likely to induce compensatory changes, named cross-modal plasticity.68 For example, congenitally deaf individuals have superior visual abilities, and blind individuals present better auditory perception. Neurons from the deprived cortex are recruited from another sensory modalities. It has been shown that the auditory cortex can be activated by visual stimuli in deaf individuals. Cross-modal interaction in the presence of sensory deprivation of 1 of the senses is a plastic phenomenon in which the brain often compensates for loss with supranormal performance in 1 or more of the intact sensory systems.” ([Coelho et al., 2020, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/RDJYHEWQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/R5H4NSZY?page=9&annotation=A5M5IZIN))
