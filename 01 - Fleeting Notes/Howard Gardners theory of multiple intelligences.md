You might have heard of Howard Gardner’s theory of Multiple Intelligences. While it has struck controversy, the 1983 version of his theory proposed a range of intelligences or talents:

- linguistic
    
- logical-mathematical
    
- spatial
    
- musical
    
- kinaesthetic
    
- naturalist
    
- interpersonal, and
    
- intrapersonal intelligences.
