My Dear Sir, fantastic article! Thanks for sharing. Beautifully written too - enjoyed reading it thoroughly.



Couple of thoughts

1. Totally agree that doctor-patient relationship initiated at the time of taking a detailed history is one of the most crucial points of the consultation. In fact I believe in the age of Airtificial Intelligence this initial human connection, empathy and touch will be the key that will set apart human doctors from the robots.
    
2. ⁠clinical skills and gadgets: while there is no argument at all regarding the necessity of skilled clinical acumen, proper use of technology has to be incorporated. as the author points out "when to order" and "how to interpret" has to be trained. This holds true again in the era of Artificial Intelligence.

3. AI is inevitable. I am not advocating "for" or "against", just that we need to harness the power of AI to enhance our own intelligence to do the thing we do,  better.

Thank you again Sir for sharing this. Lakshan
