**Thank you for inviting me over to deliver this talk. And for the kind words of introduction. Although many things were told about me I like to summerise that in the following sentence:

I am a person who always try to use technology whatever it may to become more efficient and productive. "Artificial Intelligence" as a technology is no different. 

  

I have three problems in doing AI lectures. 

1. Diversity of the audience
    
2. Evolving Toolset : most of the things we are going to discuss is likely to get outdated or replaced by newer and better tools 
    
3. Time 
    

  

In a response to these challenges,  may I propose the following:

1.  Long form of the presentation I will make available online for you to access at your convenience
    
2. I will try to make this as interactive as possible 
    
3. I will show a demonstration on a practical situation so that you will be able to understand the power AI brings to table and may be able to adapt it to your use cases.
    

  
  

There are three components for this lecture

First To ensure we're all on the same page, I'll begin with a discussion of the fundamentals of AI technologies. 

  
Then I will highlight some implications for Military Medicine

  
Thirdly, I will take you through a workflow I used to create this presentation 
  
  

Ok lets move on to the first section

## AI fundamentals:

When artificial intelligence came about it was all rule based systems and knowledge representations.

Then came the second stage of machine learning, there was a transition to data driven approaches supervised learning and algorithm improvements

Third epoch is where Deep learning with neural networks, Convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks emerged. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models primarily used for analyzing visual data. They are particularly effective for image recognition and classification tasks. Here are some key features:

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply convolutional filters to input data, allowing the model to capture spatial hierarchies and patterns.

Pooling Layers: Pooling reduces the dimensionality of the data, retaining essential features while decreasing computation.

Activation Functions: Non-linear functions (like ReLU) are applied to introduce non-linearity into the model, enabling it to learn complex patterns.

Fully Connected Layers: At the end of the network, fully connected layers aggregate features learned by previous layers to make final predictions.

Applications :

• Image and video recognition

• Object detection

• Medical image analysis

• Autonomous vehicles

CNNs have revolutionized fields requiring visual data processing, achieving state-of-the-art results in various benchmarks. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks designed for processing sequential data. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have connections that loop back on themselves, allowing them to maintain a form of memory. This makes them particularly suited for tasks involving time series data, natural language processing, and other sequential inputs.

  

Key Features:

Memory: RNNs can remember previous inputs due to their internal state.

Sequential Processing: They process inputs in order, making them ideal for sequences.

Variations: Common types include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), which address issues like vanishing gradients.

  

Applications:

-  Language modeling and text generation

-  Speech recognition

-  Time series forecasting

-  Music generation

  

Limitations:

-  Difficulty in learning long-range dependencies

-  Training can be time-consuming and complex

  

RNNs are foundational in many modern AI applications, especially those involving sequential data.

  

Naturally these developments permeated to the field of healthcare. With integration of Big Data  and and enhancing computing power cloud computing and GPUs

  

Big Data  refers to the vast volumes of structured and unstructured data generated every second, which traditional data processing software cannot manage efficiently. Key characteristics include:

  

1. Volume:  Large amounts of data generated from various sources.
2. Velocity: The speed at which data is generated and processed.
3. Variety: Different types of data (text, images, videos, etc.).
4. Veracity: The quality and accuracy of the data.
5. Value: The insights and benefits derived from analyzing the data.

  

Big Data technologies, like Hadoop and Spark, are used for storage, processing, and analysis, enabling organizations to make informed decisions.

  
So all these made diagnostic tools, predictive analysis and real time decision support systems. So these will transform the future of health care and future trajectories include personalised medicine Integration with wearables and Internet of Things and Collaborative systems 

Collaborative systems in the context of AI refer to technologies and frameworks that enable multiple agents (humans or machines) to work together to achieve common goals. Key aspects include:

  

1. Multi-Agent Systems: AI agents that interact and collaborate to solve problems, share information, and make decisions.

  

2. Human-AI Collaboration: Systems designed to enhance human capabilities through AI support, such as decision-making tools and virtual assistants.

  

3. Crowdsourcing:: Utilizing collective intelligence from a large group of people to gather data, solve problems, or generate ideas.

  

4. Distributed Learning: Techniques like federated learning, where models are trained across multiple devices while keeping data decentralized.

  

5. Shared Knowledge Bases: Platforms that allow for the sharing and updating of information among users and AI systems, enhancing learning and performance.

  

6. Communication Protocols: Frameworks that define how agents (human or AI) communicate and coordinate their actions effectively.

  

These systems aim to leverage the strengths of both AI and human intelligence to improve efficiency, creativity, and problem-solving capabilities.

  

To summarise all these  imagine LLM as a fully read researcher, and AI that you interact with as a medical intern, Neural network like your brain and machine learning a s the proces of learning medicine supervised and unsupervised

  

This is paramount as I firmly believe in this quote by Karim Makhani “ Ai won't replace humans but humans with Ai will replace Humans without Ai”

So it is incumbent upon us as both individuals and those responsible to decision making at institutional level to take up the challenge of comprehending the implications and applications of ai technologies

  

What  are the military implications of this transformative technology?

  

Rapid Diagnosis and Triage

Systems must provide quick, accurate diagnostics in high-pressure or combat scenarios.

  

Resource Optimization:

Decision-making algorithms should efficiently allocate limited resources and personnel.

  
  

Field-Ready Technology

Tools must function reliably in rugged, austere, and varied environmental conditions.

  
  

Telemedicine Integration

Effective remote consultation systems are essential, especially in deployed settings.

  
  

Data Security and Privacy:

Robust safeguards are needed to protect sensitive patient and operational data.

  

Interoperability

 Systems should seamlessly integrate with existing military communications and medical protocols.

  

Training and Simulation: 

AI-driven simulations and VR can enhance preparedness and skill training for military healthcare providers.

  

Ethical and Legal Considerations:

Addressing accountability, informed consent, and the ethical use of AI in high-stakes environments is critical.

  

Adaptability and Scalability:

Solutions must be flexible to meet varying mission requirements and adaptable to evolving battlefield conditions.

  

These considerations ensure that the integration of AI into military medicine supports efficient, secure, and effective patient care even under the most challenging conditions.

  

But they come with some important ethical considerations and challenges

Regulatory Hurdles

Data Privacy & Security: Ensuring patient data and military operations remain secure when utilizing AI tools.

Ethical Implications

Balancing technological advancements with ethical considerations, especially in sensitive military contexts.

Reliability & Accountability:

Managing errors in decision-making processes that are not transparent (often called "black-box" systems) involves identifying and correcting mistakes that occur within these complex systems. It is important to have human oversight to ensure that decisions made by these systems are fair, accurate, and ethical. This means that while machines can make decisions, humans should still review and guide these processes to prevent potential issues.

  

Now let's move on to the third part of the presentation
I will demonstrate how this presentation was made.
  

First lets find the sources: I used Perplexity AI and Deep Research platforms like Gemini, and Deepseek to get the sources.

Then the sources were fed in to notebook LM

Then "intelligent interrogations" get briefing documents, answering releavnt questions creating quizzes to check the understanding was done.

And may be create a podcast using the deep dive feature of the notebookLM and once the subject is fully comprehended the slide deck was prepared.


What just happened in strengthening our understanding of the subject and creating strong neural pathways so that learning happens. So this process not only helps ENT training but goes beyond, hence the change in the original title. 

In summary I have given you an overview what AI is, then I moved on to discuss how AI influence health care in general and in Military Medicine In particular and then we moved on to a practical demonstration in using AI in learning a particular topic. 

Hope the article was helpful for you and should you have any questions please feel free to ask
