###### Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder ANSD

######  Note

CONTEXT:

Recent onset hearing loss in an otherwise normal child presented to me for second opinion
Very Bad ABR with normal OAE suggestive of ANSD


Features
1. normal cochlear function
2. abnormal ABR
3. if transtympanically stimulated wave V can be obtained, therefore suggestive of "resynchronisation"
4. above is indicative of why cochlear implantation is successful in cognitively normal kids

“In an electrically evoked ABR (with transtympanic stimulation), it is possible to see a wave V. • This indicates that with enough electrical stimulation, you can “resynchronize” the auditory pathway. This may explain why some auditory neuropathy patients perform well with cochlear implants (especially those with no other cognitive or developmental disorders).” ([“Self-assessment in otolaryngology”, 2017, p. 49](zotero://select/library/items/KVG5I4WB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UQHDALZU?page=60&annotation=UAUHWT6G))
