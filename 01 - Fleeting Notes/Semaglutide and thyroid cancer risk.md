Dr Semaka Jayasekara was all hyped up about a patient who developed thyroid papillary carcinoma on FNAC. He is of the view the thyroid ca is of the type cell type C and since there is awkward evidence of rodent studies, this is causative. 

How simple minded these seniors are? I am not degrading them but it’s clear the level of thinking even at surgical things seem to be “unacceptable “ to say the least. 

It turned out to be a papillary ca as it stands, meet be the histology is different. But that doesn’t make him right.
