Cytokines and chemokines are both types of signaling molecules involved in the immune system's response to infection and inflammation, but they have distinct roles and characteristics:

- **Cytokines** are a broad category of small proteins important in cell signaling. They can be produced by a wide variety of cells and impact the behavior of other cells. Cytokines include interleukins, interferons, tumor necrosis factors, and growth factors. They are involved in various physiological processes, including inflammation, immune responses, cell growth, and tissue repair. Cytokines can have pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects and play roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses.

- **Chemokines** are a subset of cytokines specifically involved in chemotaxis, the process by which cells move toward or away from certain chemical signals. Chemokines primarily attract leukocytes (white blood cells) to sites of infection or inflammation, guiding the movement of immune cells to where they are needed in the body. They play critical roles in immune surveillance and in coordinating the migration of immune cells during immune responses, tissue repair, and development.

In summary, while all chemokines are cytokines, not all cytokines are chemokines. The main difference lies in the specific function of chemokines in chemotaxis, directing the movement of cells, especially immune cells, towards sites of infection or injury, whereas cytokines have broader roles in cell signaling across various physiological and pathological processes.
