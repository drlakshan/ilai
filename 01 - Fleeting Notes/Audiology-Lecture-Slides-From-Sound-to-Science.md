---

## SLIDE 4: The Auditory Pathway Framework
### Our Roadmap for AI Integration

**7 Stages of Sound Processing:**
1. External Ear → Sound collection
2. Middle Ear → Amplification
3. Cochlea → Frequency analysis
4. Auditory Nerve → Encoding & transmission
5. Brainstem → Initial processing
6. Auditory Cortex → Interpretation
7. Higher Centers → Understanding, meaning, emotion

**Each stage teaches us where AI fits - and where it doesn't**

---

## SLIDE 5: Three Zones of the Pathway
### AI Integration Map

**PERIPHERAL ZONE (External → Cochlea)**
- Data collection & pattern recognition
- **AI EXCELS HERE**

**TRANSMISSION ZONE (Nerve → Brainstem)**
