"In [[Semont maneuver]] patient was seated on examination table with legs hanging then head was rotated 45° horizontally toward the unaffected ear. After that patient was tilted 105° so that patient was lying on the side of the affected ear with patient's head hanging and nose pointed upward. Patient remains in this position for around 3 min—allowing debris to move to the apex of the ear canal. Then patient was moved quickly from the seated position, holding patient's head in place, until patient was lying on the side of the unaffected ear with patient's nose pointed to the ground. Patient remains in this position for 3 min allowing the debris to move toward the exit of the ear canal. Then patient was moved slowly back to the seated position. The debris should fall into the utricle of the canal, where it will no longer cause vertigo sensation" ([Gupta 2019:100](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/37DJH5U4?page=2))
