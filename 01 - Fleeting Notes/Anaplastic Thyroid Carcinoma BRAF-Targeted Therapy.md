# What Did I learn?


BRAF V600E mutation as critical predictive marker transforming ATC prognosis.

#### BRAF V600E in ATC
• Present in 20-50% of anaplastic thyroid cancers
• Not indicative of less aggressive tumor biology
• Critical predictive (not prognostic) marker

#### Targeted Therapy Impact
• BRAF/MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib + trametinib)
• Dramatic treatment responses possible
• Survival beyond one year achievable subset
• Modern era prognosis alteration

#### Clinical Implementation
• Mandatory BRAF testing all ATC cases
• Rapid molecular turnaround essential
• Combined with conventional multimodal therapy

#### Therapeutic Contrast
• BRAF-negative ATC: No approved targeted options
• RAS-mutant ATC: Equally aggressive, limited treatments
