		1. "The Digital Wall" : Barrier 
		2. Distracted
		3. Confidentiality : patient information is sacrosanct
		4. visual privacy : be aware of your surroundings when viewing patient data
		5. Device Policy of the hospital 
		6. Password protected and encrypted
		7. Mindful Social Media Presence: Avoid patient-identifiable information and unprofessional conduct online.
		8. Professional Digital Communication: Use formal language and tone in emails and official messaging platforms.
		9. Verifying Digital Information: Rely on evidence-based, peer-reviewed sources over general web search for clinical information.
		10. Managing Your Digital Footprint: Be aware that online activity can have long-term professional consequences.
		11. Telemedicine Etiquette: Ensure a professional environment, appropriate attire, and clear communication during virtual patient interactions.

2. Transformative Impact of Digital Health : not a future concept but standard of care
	1. from paper to pixels EHR
	2. AI : radiology and dermatology as an example
	3. information at the finder tips BNF medical calculators
3. Adpapting to and Utilizing Digital Platforms - Confidence in technology is a clinical skill
	1. Power User of EHR if you have
	2. Curate your digital tool kit : Drug Reference Clinical Scoring Medical Literature access
	3. Embrace telehealth


4. Understanding AI as a superpower
	1. fear of AI will replace doctors is misplaced
	2. doctors who use AI will replace / outshine doctors who dont
	3. Augmented Intelligence Not Artificial Replacement : analyse vast datasets, identify patterns you might miss/invisible to human eye, handle repetitive tasks, freeing up to do what you do best
		1. COMPLEX DECISION MAKING PATIENT COMMUNICATION AND PROVIDING EMPATHETIC CARE
			1. Cure sometimes, relieve most of the time and care all the time
			2. "dukkapaththach niddukka; bhayppathacha nibbaya, sokapaththacha nissoka honthu sabbe pi panino"

		2. you bring clinical judgment, experience, and need to do the direct clininical interaction
5. Commttment to Continous Learning as a "TEch-Savvy Doctor"
	1. your medical degree is the starting point not the finish line
	2. Cultivate a growth mindset : approach new tech with curiosity not apprehension
	3. Stay informed participate in Workshops and training onthese
	4. Reverse Mentoship:  you as a digital native may have skills and perspectives that are valuable to your seniors, be open and share

SPIDER MAN ANALOGY

. The Origin Story
   * For Spider-Man: He was an ordinary, bright student until a single
     transformative event—the bite from a radioactive spider—gave him
     extraordinary powers.
   * For the Intern: They were an ordinary person until they went through
     their own transformative "bite": the grueling, intense process of
     medical school. This has given them the "power" to practice medicine,
     write prescriptions, and make decisions that directly impact human
     lives.

  2. The Superpowers
   * For Spider-Man: He has enhanced strength, agility, and his famous
     "Spidey-Sense" which acts as an early warning system for danger.
   * For the Intern: Their "superpowers" are their deep medical knowledge and
      clinical skills. You can frame AI and digital diagnostics as their 
     "Spidey-Sense." It's a new, powerful tool that can analyze vast amounts
     of data to warn them of potential diagnoses, flag deteriorating
     patients, or spot patterns they might otherwise miss. It enhances their
     natural abilities.

  3. The Core Moral Lesson
   * For Spider-Man: His defining moment was letting a robber go, who then
     killed his Uncle Ben. This taught him the harsh lesson: "With great 
     power comes great responsibility."
   * For the Intern: This is the absolute core of medical ethics. The power
     they wield is immense, and every patient interaction carries that same
     weight. An oversight is not just a mistake; it can have profound
     consequences for a person and their family. Their power is a trust
     given to them for the sole purpose of helping others.

  4. The Adversaries
   * For Spider-Man: He fights a roster of tangible super-villains like
     Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus.
   * For the Intern: Their "villains" are more abstract but no less
     dangerous. They fight Disease, Diagnostic Uncertainty, Systemic 
     Failures, Information Overload, and a particularly modern villain:
     Burnout. A key point here is that blind reliance on AI can also become
     a "villain" if it overrides their own clinical judgment.

  5. Mastering the Tools
   * For Spider-Man: The spider bite didn't give him his web-shooters. He
     had to use his own intelligence and skill to invent, build, and master
     them. They are a tool he controls.
   * For the Intern: Similarly, they must actively master their digital 
     tools. Using the hospital's electronic medical record system or a new AI
      program isn't a passive activity. They must learn their intricacies,
     their shortcuts, and especially their limitations to wield them
     effectively and safely.

  6. The Dual Identity
   * For Spider-Man: He constantly struggles with the strain of balancing
     his duties as a hero with his personal life as Peter Parker.
   * For the Intern: This is a direct parallel to the challenge of
     maintaining a personal identity outside of the hospital. It's a perfect
     way to talk about the importance of self-care, hobbies, and
     relationships to prevent the all-consuming nature of the job from
     leading to burnout.
