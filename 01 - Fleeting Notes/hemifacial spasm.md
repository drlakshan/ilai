# Note

in patients with repeated facial nerve twitching sometimes there may be a vascular loop




# Context:
In learning vascular loops, the most studied condition was cited as hemifacial spasm

“Direct compression theory: Nervous hyperfunction and demyelination derived from the mechanical stimulation of the vessels.7 Endogenous inflammatory theory: The hemifacial spasm occurs as a consequence of intrinsic neuronal activity derived from the repetitive stimulation, which could constitute the base of successful management with anticonvulsants and modulators of the excitatory response such as benzodiazepines.” ([“Vascular loop in the cerebellopontine angle: Clinical-radiological correlation - ClinicalKey”, p. 408](zotero://select/library/items/2AFE3B35)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IMPZ7QXR?page=2&annotation=DRAEBWTR))
