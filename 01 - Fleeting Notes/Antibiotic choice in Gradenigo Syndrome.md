# Reference

“Our current choice includes ceftriaxone along with vancomycin and metronidazole.

In our series, 77% of patients were treated solely with antibiotics. Only 23% underwent some kind of major surgical intervention.” ([Gadre and Chole, 2018, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/34DL6QBS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D9PH7R7S?page=6&annotation=KHSVCPV7))
