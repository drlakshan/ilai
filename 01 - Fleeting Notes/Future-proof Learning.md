### **“The Infinite Learner: Medicine, Mind, and Machine”**

**Tagline:** _Future-Proof Your Learning — Where Human Wisdom Meets Artificial Intelligence._


**Description:**  
In the anatomy lab, we dissect cadavers. In this course, we dissect _learning itself_. _The Infinite Learner_ explores how to think, adapt, and grow in an ever-shifting landscape of AI and medical innovation. It’s about building cognitive endurance — so that every discovery, disruption, or dataset becomes not a threat, but an invitation to evolve. The smartest doctor of the future won’t know it all — they’ll _know how to keep learning it all.
