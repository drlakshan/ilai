# Progressive Sensorineural Hearing Loss (PSNHL)

## Foundational Principles
### Defining the Condition
#### Core Definition of SNHL
- Pathology in inner ear (cochlea, CN VIII)
- Most prevalent form (~90%)

#### "Progressive" Qualifier
- Worsens over time (critical distinction)
- Implies active, ongoing pathological process
- Mandates extensive etiological investigation

#### Onset Timing
- Congenital (present at birth)
- Acquired (develops after birth)
  - Pre-lingual (before language)
  - Post-lingual (after language)

## Pathophysiology
### Role of Cochlear Hair Cells
- Primary sensory receptors (IHCs, OHCs)
- Responsible for mechanotransduction
- Cannot regenerate (irreversible loss)
