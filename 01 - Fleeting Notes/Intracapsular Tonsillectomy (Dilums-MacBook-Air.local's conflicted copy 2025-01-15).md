######  Note

CONTEXT:

It was discussed in the paediatric ENT complications lecture that intracapsular tonsillectomy has reduced pain and bleeding.


Definition.

Also known as tonsillotomy, intracapsular tonsillectomy aims to remove tonsillar tissue using powered instruments (debrider, coblator, CO2 laser) or scissors with diathermy UPTO the capsule only.

Good for OSA may not be so for recurrent tonsillitis cases and there is a 6% regrowth rate.

    Intracapsular tonsillectomy or tonsillotomy was introduced in the mid-1990s in Sweden by Densert and coauthors under the hypothesis that a subtotal tonsillectomy would reduce postoperative morbidity while still relieving upper airway obstruction in children with SDB/OSA.

As this inherently leaves tonsillar tissue behind, this procedure is generally not performed for recurrent tonsillitis and results in approximately 6% tonsillar regrowth.
