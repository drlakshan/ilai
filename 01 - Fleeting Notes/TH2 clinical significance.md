Several types of sinusitis are associated with Th2 inflammation.  The most prominent are:

* **Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (eCRS):** This is a subtype of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) characterized by a significant presence of eosinophils in the nasal and sinus tissues.  It's strongly associated with a Th2 immune response.

* **Central compartment atopic disease (CCAD):**  This is a distinct phenotype of CRS, often presenting with a "black halo" appearance on CT scans.  It's also strongly linked to Th2 inflammation and allergic triggers.

* **Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS):**  While not solely a Th2 response, AFRS involves a complex interplay of Th2 responses and fungal antigens.  The Th2 response plays a significant role in the inflammatory cascade.

It's important to note that while these are the most prominent types, other forms of CRS can also have a component of Th2 inflammation, though not as consistently or prominently as in the above examples.
