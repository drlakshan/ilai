3. when the COVID 19 hit in the 2020, no income at all.
4. Fuel crisis made it impossible to for us to oversee
5. They were informed to find alternate employement as the estate was unsustainable and  most like to be sold or rented.
6. Then came a family dispute with wife calling us not to send money to Karunadasa but to her complaining there is woman he has got in to the house and the gates were cloased and this woman was chased off
7. That really triggered the termination and estate was handed over to the original person who got the estate for us to either sell or rescue it. He started searching for people to rent it with profit sharing basis.
8. Karunadasa was sent off with three months salary.
9. Whatever the motive may be they have loadged a complaint.
10. I got a call from Kumari - wife of Karunadasa complaining against karunadasa for having an underaged female there and asked for money for speaking on my side. ofcourse this was declined based on my principles
11. Now here we are in a labor dispute court.
12. Going forward I would like to know what are the measures and methods available to protect the employers or land lords.
13. What are the documents that can be used to sign with the labourers? Need to get copies and make sure this doesnt replicate at Dambadeniya

Apparently the problem is that they desrve EPF etc and their service is abruptly disrupted. 
Law is even if there is a single employee we have to pay EPF. Didnt know that, I am not alone and even the professionals didn't know. 
Take it as another learning point in the life's journey. The growth mindset.
