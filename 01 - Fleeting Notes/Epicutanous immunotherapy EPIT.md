This is a form of immunotherapy where we can use patches and straps to deliver low does allergen to achieve immunotherapy
tape stripping
Dermoabrasion

This method is preferred by some because there is no need for injections

However the evidence is not strong

# Reference

Epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) is a non-invasive form of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in which allergens are applied to the skin using patches [1, 2]. **This method is preferred by some because it does not require injections** [1]. Several techniques have been used to deliver the antigen to the skin, including:

- tape stripping
- abrasion of the skin,
- application of patches to accumulate sweat [1, 3]

Powder-based AIT has also been delivered to the epidermis using:

- microneedle arrays
- laser-mediated microporation [1, 3]

**There is very limited evidence on the efficacy of EPIT for allergic rhinitis (AR) due to inhalant allergy**. [1] The current evidence is limited to multiple single-center, double-blind randomized control trials comparing grass patches to placebo patches [1]. **There has been no comparison of EPIT to the more widely used subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)** [1].

**EPIT has shown mixed results in terms of efficacy, and, because of the lack of data, no extensive statistical analysis has been done** [1, 4]. **Both local and systemic reactions are common with EPIT** [5-7]. The International Consensus on Allergy and Rhinology (ICAR) document recommends against using EPIT [5-7].

However, EPIT remains a promising modality for improving the convenience of AIT [5]. If it can be made safe, EPIT may be a more convenient option for both children and adults than SCIT and SLIT, as it avoids weekly injections and clinic visits, as well as the oral and gastrointestinal side effects of SLIT [5].
