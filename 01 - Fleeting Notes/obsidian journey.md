######  Note


this is a small note with steps of how learning is progressing in Obsidian. This is a GEM no doubt about that. with the help of  Anki and Zotero, I am going to be a unstoppable learning machine!
I can already see how things are evolving. a lot to learn. lets begin. This is an attempt to document how things are evolving


1. got to know about Obsidian
2. Zettlekasten technique - I cant exactly remember how I came across this concept May be I was really in to Anki those days and I was seeing how these flashcards were connecting to each other and then came across some articles on the web. Got to know  Niklas Luhmann and thing took off from there. 
3. Gradually my obsidian vault grew
4. Tried many ways to keep devices synced and finally decided to use Megasync ( as it has my zotero library as well) and use desktop and laptop for work and use mobile apps to just browse. I will be working on the laptop anyways. That way I wil be utilising the macbook too.
5. Gradually notes grew and attending the AAO HNS added quite alot of notes. There is some more lectures to go through and add notes and Anki cards
6. There was a period of dullness and with ASANA focus on the revival of obsidian again renewed interest and things are moving again
7. Got to know about the [[Obsidian Roundup]]
8. Got this article https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-boost-your-productivity-for-scientific-research-using-obsidian-fe85c98c63c8where I was introduced to power search which is going to be a game changer
9. Canvas was introduced to beta testers version 1.1.3 ( i think ) and I decided to become an insider by paying 25 USD and use it . It was useful but need to use it more often.


CONTEXT:



I am learning and expanding. whatever the outcome may be I want to learn and keep on doing this.
