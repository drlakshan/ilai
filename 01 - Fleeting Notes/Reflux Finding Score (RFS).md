Endoscopic scoring of following 8 items with total score out of 26.

  The eight findings are:

   1. Infraglottic oedema (also called pseudosulcus vocalis)
   2. Ventricular obliteration
   3. Erythema/hyperaemia (redness)
   4. Vocal fold oedema (swelling)
   5. Diffuse laryngeal oedema
   6. Posterior commissure hypertrophy (thickening)
   7. Granuloma or granulation tissue
   8. Thick endolaryngeal mucus

# scoring



1. Subglottic Edema:
   * 0: Absent
   * 2: Present

  2. Ventricular Obliteration:
   * 2: Partial
   * 4: Complete

  3. Erythema/Hyperemia (Redness):
   * 2: Affects arytenoids only
   * 4: Diffuse (widespread)

  4. Vocal Fold Edema:
   * 1: Mild
   * 2: Moderate
   * 3: Severe
   * 4: Polypoid (polyp-like)

  5. Diffuse Laryngeal Edema:
   * 1: Mild
   * 2: Moderate
   * 3: Severe
   * 4: Obstructive

  6. Posterior Commissure Hypertrophy (Thickening):
   * 1: Mild
   * 2: Moderate
   * 3: Severe
   * 4: Obstructive

  7. Granuloma/Granulation Tissue:
   * 0: Absent
   * 2: Present

  8. Thick Endolaryngeal Mucus:
   * 0: Absent
   * 2: Present

  These scores are added together for a total score out of 26. As noted
  in your textbook, a score greater than 7 is generally considered a
  positive indicator for LPR.
