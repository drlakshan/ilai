To my daughter Sudu Dhoni



At the Horton plains 
Among the company of friends
One thing is plain
I can never be happy without you by my side

Determined never to do
These useless things in the future 
If it doesn’t bring happiness 
Why bother in the first place


context:
[[At Horton Plains without Signals]]
