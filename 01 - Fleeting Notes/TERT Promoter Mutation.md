TERT mutation : Telemerase Reverse Transcriptase gene mutation


### **Why It Matters in Cancer**

The consequence of a TERT mutation is that cancer cells can continuously rebuild their telomeres. This overcomes the natural limit on cell division, granting them a form of **cellular immortality**. They can divide endlessly without their chromosomes degrading, which is a critical step for tumor growth and progression.

TERT promoter mutations are among the most common mutations in human cancers and are frequently found in:

*   Glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer)
*   Bladder cancer
*   Melanoma
*   Thyroid cancer
*   Hepatocellular carcinoma (a type of liver cancer)
