# What Did I learn?

BRAFV600E (Aggressive features, higher recurrence risk)
TERT Promoter Mutations (Strongly associated with worse outcomes)
BRAF + TERT Synergy (Markedly high recurrence/mortality risk)
RAS Mutations (Indolent course if solitary, follicular variant)
RET/PTC Rearrangements (Often excellent long-term survival in young patients)
TP53 Mutation (Hallmark of dedifferentiation, ominous sign)
