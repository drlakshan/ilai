Summary points

### Major Takeaways from *Die with Zero* by Bill Perkins

#### 1. **Time is More Valuable Than Money**
   - Money can be saved and earned again, but time is a finite resource. The value of time increases as you age, making it crucial to use your time intentionally.

#### 2. **Focus on Experiences Over Savings**
   - Life is made richer through experiences. Prioritize spending on activities and memories that bring fulfillment rather than hoarding money for an uncertain future.

#### 3. **Spend Money When It Matters Most**
   - Match your spending to your energy and health levels. The younger you are, the more physically capable you are of enjoying certain activities. Don’t postpone spending on experiences you can enjoy now.

#### 4. **The Life Experience Curve (XP)**
   - Think of life as an opportunity to accumulate "experience points" (XP). The goal is to maximize the number of meaningful and memorable experiences throughout your lifetime.

#### 5. **Die with Zero**
   - Aim to deplete your wealth by the end of your life. This doesn’t mean being reckless but strategically planning so that your money aligns with your needs and aspirations, ensuring you don’t waste time over-saving.

#### 6. **Give Inheritance Early**
   - Instead of leaving a large inheritance when you die, consider giving it earlier when your children or loved ones can benefit most from it. This ensures your legacy positively impacts their lives while you’re still alive.

#### 7. **The Health-Wealth Tradeoff**
   - Health declines as you age, so plan your experiences to align with periods when you’re physically capable of enjoying them. Waiting too long can mean missed opportunities due to poor health.

#### 8. **Don’t Delay Enjoyment for Retirement**
   - Many people postpone living fully for their retirement years. The book challenges this mindset, advocating for a balance between saving and spending to enjoy life at all stages.

#### 9. **Use "Net Fulfillment" as a Measure**
   - Calculate the fulfillment derived from spending money. If spending leads to more happiness and satisfaction than saving, it’s worth it. Optimize for joy and fulfillment, not just financial growth.

#### 10. **Plan for Decay**
   - Life isn’t infinite, so acknowledge the reality of physical and mental decline. Spend your money in alignment with your remaining time, focusing on activities that bring joy at each stage of life.

#### 11. **Track Your Memory Dividend**
   - Memories provide lasting dividends. Investing in experiences now means you can relive and cherish them for years to come, adding to your happiness over time.

#### 12. **Don’t Save Excessively for the Unknown**
   - Over-saving for unlikely worst-case scenarios means sacrificing experiences you could enjoy today. Strike a balance between reasonable safety nets and living fully.

#### 13. **Maximize Utility from Money**
   - Money has different utility at different stages of life. A dollar spent in your 30s or 40s often has more life-enhancing value than the same dollar spent in your 70s or 80s.

#### 14. **Prioritize Relationships**
   - Invest time and money in creating meaningful connections with family, friends, and loved ones. Shared experiences are some of the most fulfilling ways to use your wealth.

#### 15. **Use Financial Planning Tools**
   - Leverage tools like annuities or careful planning to ensure you don’t run out of money but also don’t leave significant unused wealth behind.

#### Conclusion
*Die with Zero* encourages a mindset shift from accumulating wealth for its own sake to intentionally using money as a tool for a richer, more fulfilling life. It’s about aligning your financial resources with your health, energy, and life goals to ensure you make the most of your limited time on Earth.
