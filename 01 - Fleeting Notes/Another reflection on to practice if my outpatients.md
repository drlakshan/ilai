Had a chat with Sathi. He advised me not to do the fraud everyone else is doing. I think I should increase my charges and show the actual and pay more retaining the same. That’s more honorable in a way. It’s not fully transparent as hospital work is downplayed. 
Another thing is as I have more surgeries during the day, it may be useful to have a half an hour rest so starting at 3:30 is a good idea. So the future sessions may be like 8:30 to 11:30 and 3:30 to 6:30 25 numbers each extra for anyone who comes. That way more people can access me and I will be paying a substantial amount to the government without losing much of my income.
