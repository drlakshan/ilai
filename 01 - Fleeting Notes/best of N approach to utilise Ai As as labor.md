Here we can ask the ai to give multiple variations of the answer we seek and as a subsequent step we can compare and contrast the solutions as well. this works because AI is cheap, fast, creative and egoless,

### What is Best-of-N?

The Best-of-N pattern leverages a unique advantage of AI labor: **it's fast, cheap, and egoless**. Unlike human developers, Claude doesn't get frustrated when you ask it to throw away work and try again.

**Traditional Development**:

- Implement one solution
    
- Stick with it (too expensive to rewrite)
    
- Hope it's the best approach
    

**AI Labor Development**:

- Implement 3-5 different solutions
    
- Compare and evaluate all of them
    
- Choose the best or combine elements
    
- Total time: Still faster than one traditional implementation
    

### Why This Works

1. **AI is fast**: What takes days for humans takes minutes for AI
    
2. **AI is cheap**: Even premium AI usage costs less than developer time
    
3. **AI is creative**: Each attempt can explore radically different approaches
    
4. **AI is egoless**: No hurt feelings when you discard its work
