###### Central compartment Neck Dissection prophylactically for differentiated thyroid carcinoma
2022-08-12- 15:38





######  Note

CONTEXT:

Dr Semaka jayasekara mentioned that central compartment neck dissection has no place in the prophylactic management in patient with DTC
I said based in risk. Guidliens favour me,


Its not recommended in routine less than 4cm, <45 years, unifocal and no extrathyroidal cases
In high risk personalised decision making

# Central compartment dissection recommendation

“Prophylactic central-compartment neck dissection (ipsilateral or bilateral) may be performed in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma with clinically uninvolved central neck lymph nodes, especially for advanced primary tumors (T3 or T4). Recommendation rating: C” ([Cooper et al., 2009, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/7DYKX4ZE)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H94YUSGG?page=14&annotation=U6MMFKLS))
