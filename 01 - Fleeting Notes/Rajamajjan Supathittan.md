Treating kings 
not just being amongst
achieved something
worth the while

would have made you proud
like the verse say
this is what every father wants
for their son to be

Although not with me physically
I am sure you would see this
be happy and be well
rest assured I will do what you wanted
















context:
Did a FOL on MR. I have treated kings like MS as well. In the gatha that worships fathers, this quality of fathers is mentioned : Raja Majjan Supatiththan
