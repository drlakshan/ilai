In Buddhism, particularly within the Theravada tradition, *Sampajañña* refers to "clear comprehension" or "clear awareness." It is a crucial concept in meditative practice, often mentioned alongside mindfulness (*sati*). According to Buddhist teachings, there are four types of *Sampajañña*:

1. **Satthaka-sampajañña (Purposeful Comprehension)**: This type of comprehension involves understanding the purpose or goal behind an action. It ensures that actions are meaningful and aligned with one's spiritual objectives[1][3][4].

2. **Sappaya-sampajañña (Suitability Comprehension)**: This involves discerning whether an action is suitable or appropriate in a given context. It ensures that actions are conducive to one's spiritual practice and well-being[3][4].

3. **Gocara-sampajañña (Domain Comprehension)**: This refers to maintaining awareness of one's meditative focus or domain. It includes understanding the internal and external fields of meditation, such as the body and its movements[3][4].

4. **Asammoha-sampajañña (Non-delusion Comprehension)**: This type of comprehension is about recognizing reality without delusion, particularly understanding the impermanent nature of phenomena. It involves clarity and wisdom in perceiving the true nature of experiences[3][4].

These four types of *Sampajañña* are integral to the practice of mindfulness and meditation, helping practitioners maintain a clear and accurate understanding of their actions and experiences.
