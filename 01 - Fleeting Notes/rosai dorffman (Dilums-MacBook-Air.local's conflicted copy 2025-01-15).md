# Reference

1. Rosai-Dorfman syndrome (RDD) is a rare disorder with abnormal histiocyte proliferation.

2. Causes significant enlargement of lymph nodes, especially in the neck.

3. Symptoms include painless lymphadenopathy, fever, rash, bone lesions, pulmonary nodules.

4. Can affect the central nervous system, causing respiratory and neurological symptoms.

5. Predominantly affects children, adolescents, young adults, especially of African descent.

6. Median age at diagnosis is 20 years, with cases up to age 70.

7. Cause is unknown; potential links to infections, autoimmune responses, genetic factors.

8. Some cases involve mutations in the MAP kinase pathway, classified as blood cancer.

9. Diagnosis involves imaging and biopsy, showing S100-positive, CD68-positive histiocytes.

10. Emperipolesis is a hallmark feature in histopathological examination.

11. Some cases resolve spontaneously; treatment varies based on symptoms and progression.

12. Observation for asymptomatic cases, surgical excision for localized disease.

13. Chemotherapy or corticosteroids used for extensive involvement.

14. Prognosis generally good; many experience complete symptom resolution.

15. Possibility of recurrent disease or complications based on histiocytic involvement extent.
