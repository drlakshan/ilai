just when you thought 
you were at the top of the game
shoved down to the ground
with shear force

need to weather this
like lord Buddha
with equinimity
and serenity

hope is still there
never give up
with the growth mindset
I will conquer


















context:

CSF leak repair patient had some post pack removal discharge
praying that it will settle
we will see.
tried my level best anyway
