Read this and say done when done :Differential Diagnosis Most common Cardiovascular conditions Acute coronary syndromes (Related: Acute Coronary Syndromes) Include unstable or crescendo angina, non–ST elevation myocardial infarction, and ST elevation myocardial infarction Typically present as retrosternal chest pain that may radiate to arms, neck, or lower jaw; may be accompanied by dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, syncope, or fatigue Diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, ECG findings, and serum cardiac troponin levels Consider acute coronary syndrome in patients presenting with anginal pain lasting more than 15 minutes 4 New ST segment elevation at the J point in 2 contiguous leads, persisting for 20 minutes or longer, suggests ST elevation myocardial infarction and is a medical emergency 19 New horizontal or down-sloping ST segment depression and T wave changes suggest non–ST elevation acute coronary syndrome Unstable or crescendo angina lacks the ECG and biochemical evidence for acute myocardial necrosis but has at least 1 of the following features: Occurs at rest or with minimal exertion Lasts at least 20 minutes if not treated with nitroglycerin Severe and new onset (within the past month) Occurs in a crescendo pattern that has progressed and is more severe, prolonged, or frequent than before Pulmonary embolism (Related: Pulmonary Embolism) Sudden obstruction of a portion of the pulmonary arterial vasculature, usually by embolization of a lower extremity or pelvic thrombus Presents with chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Tachycardia and ST abnormalities on ECG, as well as an elevated cardiac troponin level, may be present Chest pain is usually pleuritic; dyspnea is usually prominent and may be overwhelming; edema, tenderness, or a palpable "cord" may be present in 1 or both lower extremities, which should raise suspicion for deep vein thrombosis Multidetector-row CT angiography is diagnostic for pulmonary embolism; identifies thrombus or thrombi in pulmonary vessels Thoracic aortic dissection Presents with sudden, severe chest pain that may radiate to the back. May be associated with hypotension or diaphoresis; nonspecific ECG changes and elevated cardiac troponin levels may be present Pain may be characterized as tearing or ripping A murmur of aortic insufficiency may be audible when the dissection extends into the aortic root; brachial or radial pulses may be asymmetrical CT with contrast enhancement is diagnostic for thoracic aortic dissection. Alternate imaging modalities include MRI and transesophageal echocardiogram Pericarditis Inflammation of the pericardium with or without pericardial effusion Typically presents as pleuritic precordial or retrosternal pain that may radiate to the back, neck, left shoulder, or arm ECG often shows PR segment depression and diffuse ST segment elevation; troponin levels may be elevated Pain is worse on inspiration, when supine, during swallowing, and during movement; pain is improved when seated and leaning forward A pericardial friction rub is sometimes heard on auscultation Echocardiography is the initial diagnostic study of choice, frequently demonstrating pericardial effusion with or without pericardial thickening Noncardiac conditions Cholecystitis (acute) (Related: Tobacco Use Disorder and Smoking Cessation) Inflammation of the gallbladder; most commonly resulting from obstruction of cystic duct by an impacted gallstone Presents with epigastric pain that may be poorly localized at first, mimicking anginal pain Nausea and vomiting are often prominent, and there is tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant Right upper quadrant ultrasonography is usually diagnostic, showing an inflamed gallbladder; stones and ductal dilation may be evident Pancreatitis (acute) (Related: Acute Pancreatitis) Sudden onset of pancreatic parenchymal inflammation with a disease course that can range from mild to severe Presents with epigastric pain, often with radiation to the back; pain may be severe Tenderness to palpation of the upper abdomen, sometimes with rebound tenderness Abdominal CT or ultrasonography shows inflammation of pancreas; lipase and amylase levels are elevated Peptic ulcer disease (Related: Peptic Ulcer Disease) Development of ulcerations in the stomach or duodenum owing to an imbalance between mucosal protective factors and various mucosal-damaging mechanisms Presents with recurrent chest or epigastric pain Pain is rarely related to exertion and may be improved by eating May have tenderness to palpation of the upper abdomen Diagnosis is confirmed on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy Esophageal spasm May present with epigastric pain or tightness, which may be relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin May be precipitated by swallowing; associated with dysphagia Pain is rarely related to exertion Sublingual nitroglycerin and certain calcium channel blockers used to treat angina can occasionally alleviate pain due to esophageal reflux or spasm Diagnosis is confirmed by manometry, which reveals premature rapid contractions, or by appearance of "corkscrew" esophagus on barium swallow Costochondritis Inflammation of costochondral junctions of ribs or chondrosternal joints May present with severe pain in the sternal area Characterized by exacerbation with chest motion (eg, respiration, rotation of the torso) Differentiated by characteristic exacerbation with physical maneuvers and absence of ECG abnormalities

Done. Is there anything else I can help you with?

please tabulate the differential diagosis

Sure, here is the differential diagnosis table for the conditions listed in the text:

System

Condition

Presentation

Diagnosis

Cardiovascular

Acute coronary syndromes

Retrosternal chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, syncope, or fatigue

History, physical examination, ECG findings, and serum cardiac troponin levels

Pulmonary embolism

Chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia; edema, tenderness, or a palpable "cord" may be present in 1 or both lower extremities

Multidetector-row CT angiography

Thoracic aortic dissection

Sudden, severe chest pain that may radiate to the back; may be associated with hypotension or diaphoresis

CT with contrast enhancement, MRI, or transesophageal echocardiogram

Pericarditis

Pleuritic precordial or retrosternal pain that may radiate to the back, neck, left shoulder, or arm; PR segment depression and diffuse ST segment elevation may be present

Echocardiography

Noncardiac

Cholecystitis

Epigastric pain that may be poorly localized at first; nausea, vomiting, and tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant may be present

Right upper quadrant ultrasonography

Pancreatitis

Epigastric pain, often with radiation to the back; tenderness to palpation of the upper abdomen, sometimes with rebound tenderness

Abdominal CT or ultrasonography, elevated lipase and amylase levels

Peptic ulcer disease

Recurrent chest or epigastric pain that may be improved by eating; tenderness to palpation of the upper abdomen may be present

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy

Esophageal spasm

Epigastric pain or tightness, which may be relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin; dysphagia may be present

Diagnosis is confirmed...

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
