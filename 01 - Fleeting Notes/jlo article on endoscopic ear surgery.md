"Five-Year Audit of Endoscopic Ear Surgery in a Resource-Poor Setting: Evaluation of Outcomes in Patients with Varied Medical Conditions"

Introduction

The increasing availability and use of endoscopic ear surgery (EES) has revolutionized the management of various ear diseases in recent years. However, the majority of studies evaluating the outcomes of EES have been conducted in resource-rich settings, with limited data available on its effectiveness in resource-poor settings. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of EES in patients with varied medical conditions over a five-year period in a resource-poor setting. We conducted a retrospective audit of all patients who underwent EES in our hospital between 2016 and 2021. Our findings have the potential to contribute to the growing body of evidence on the effectiveness of EES in resource-poor settings, and inform future interventions to improve the management of ear diseases in these settings.


Methods

This study is a retrospective audit of all patients who underwent endoscopic ear surgery (EES) between March 2017 and April 2022 at our hospital. A total of 190 cases were included in the study.

Data collection was performed by reviewing electronic medical records and surgical notes. The following data were collected for each patient: age, gender, medical history, diagnosis, type of surgery performed, duration of surgery, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, and follow-up data.

The data were entered into a secure electronic database for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data, including means, medians, and standard deviations for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.

Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of our hospital. All patient information was kept confidential and anonymous, and the study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature and potential for selection bias, as patients were not randomized to treatment groups. Additionally, as this study was conducted at a single institution, the results may not be generalizable to other settings.



Results 

A total of 190 patients underwent endoscopic ear surgery (EES) between March 2017 and April 2022. Of these, 147 (77.4%) underwent myringoplasty, 31 (16.3%) underwent mastoid exploration, 2 (1.1%) underwent excision of glomus tympanicum, 6 (3.2%) underwent stapedectomy, and 4 (2.1%) underwent excision of osteoma. Additionally, all grommet insertions and examination under anaesthesia of ears (EUA EARS) were carried out endoscopically.

In patients with suppurative ear disease, a success rate of 97.19% (175/178) was achieved, as defined by a dry ear without residual perforation. Grommet insertions were performed without difficulty, and all cases had in situ grommets at follow-up. Among the six patients who underwent stapedectomy, five had a closed air-bone gap, indicating successful surgery. However, one patient experienced a perilymphatic gusher and persistent conductive hearing loss.

In the two patients who underwent excision of glomus tympanicum, one had a residual perforation following surgery, while the other had no complications.

Overall, our results suggest that endoscopic ear surgery is a safe and effective option for the management of various ear diseases, including myringoplasty, mastoid exploration, glomus tympanicum excision, stapedectomy, and osteoma excision. Furthermore, our success rate for suppurative ear cases is comparable to previously reported success rates for traditional surgical approaches.

Conclusions
This retrospective audit of 190 cases of endoscopic ear surgery (EES) over a five-year period in a resource-poor setting demonstrates its effectiveness in the management of various ear diseases. Our success rate for suppurative ear cases is comparable to previously reported success rates for traditional surgical approaches, indicating that EES is a safe and effective option for these cases. Additionally, all grommet insertions and examination under anaesthesia of ears (EUA EARS) were performed endoscopically without difficulty.

Our results also demonstrate successful outcomes for other EES procedures, including myringoplasty, mastoid exploration, glomus tympanicum excision, stapedectomy, and osteoma excision. While there were some complications in a small number of cases, these were largely manageable and did not significantly affect overall success rates.

Overall, our findings suggest that EES can be a valuable tool in the management of ear diseases in resource-poor settings, where traditional surgical approaches may not be as readily available or feasible. Further research is needed to continue evaluating the effectiveness of EES in these settings and to identify ways to further optimize its use.
