“Surgical oedema and haematoma formation as a result of naso-tracheal intubation during orthognathic surgery are thought to cause soft tissue swelling in the nasopharynx. This may lead to blockage of the Eustachian tube precipitating the formation of a middle ear effusion.1” ([Algudkar et al., 2013, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/7X78PM5B)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VXXZILX?page=3&annotation=GZVFFKU8))
