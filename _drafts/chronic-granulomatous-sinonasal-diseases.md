Briefing on Chronic Granulomatous Diseases of the Sinonasal Tract and Skin

Executive Summary

Chronic granulomatous conditions affecting the sinonasal tract and skin encompass a diverse and complex spectrum of diseases, unified by the histopathological finding of a granuloma—an organized collection of immune cells. These conditions present a significant diagnostic challenge due to considerable overlap in clinical symptoms, which often include non-specific issues like nasal obstruction, chronic discharge, crusting, facial pain, and destructive lesions.

The etiologies can be broadly classified into four main categories: infectious, inflammatory/autoimmune, neoplastic, and substance-induced.

1. Infectious diseases are a primary cause, including mycobacterial infections like Tuberculosis and Leprosy, other bacterial infections such as Rhinoscleroma and Syphilis, and invasive fungal diseases like Granulomatous Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis (GIFRS) and Mucormycosis.
2. Inflammatory and autoimmune disorders are driven by a dysregulated immune response. Key conditions include ANCA-associated vasculitides like Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) and Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA), as well as systemic disorders like Sarcoidosis.
3. Neoplastic mimics, particularly Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, can present with aggressive, destructive midline lesions that clinically resemble severe inflammatory conditions.
4. Other mimics include Cocaine-Induced Midline Destructive Lesions (CIMDL) and the genetic immunodeficiency Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD).

Accurate diagnosis is paramount, as treatments are radically different, ranging from antimicrobial agents for infections to potent immunosuppression for autoimmune diseases and chemotherapy for malignancies. A misdiagnosis can be catastrophic; for example, treating an undiagnosed lymphoma with immunosuppressants can accelerate tumor growth. The diagnostic cornerstone is a deep tissue biopsy with comprehensive histopathological analysis, often supplemented by serological testing (e.g., ANCA), microbiology, and imaging. Differentiating between severe destructive conditions like GPA, NK/T-cell Lymphoma, and CIMDL represents the most critical diagnostic hurdle.

Introduction: Granulomatous Inflammation

Granulomatous inflammation is a distinct pattern of chronic tissue reaction characterized by the focal aggregation of immune cells, primarily macrophages. This response is a sophisticated host defense mechanism designed to contain and isolate persistent, non-degradable agents that conventional inflammatory processes have failed to eliminate.

* Pathophysiology: Granuloma formation is a cytokine-driven process initiated when phagocytes cannot eradicate an offending agent. This triggers a cell-mediated immune response where T-lymphocytes release interferon-gamma (IFN-\gamma) and macrophages secrete tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\alpha). These cytokines promote the recruitment and transformation of macrophages into epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells (e.g., Langhans giant cells), which form a nodular structure to "wall off" the inciting agent.
* Role in Disease: While protective, the granuloma itself is often the primary driver of pathology. The physical mass can compress adjacent structures, and the activated immune cells release enzymes and reactive oxygen species that cause collateral damage to healthy tissue. Over time, this chronic inflammation leads to fibrosis, scarring, and loss of organ function.
* Caseating vs. Non-Caseating Granulomas: A critical histopathological distinction is the presence or absence of central necrosis, which provides a powerful clue to the underlying etiology.
  * Caseating Granulomas: Characterized by a core of amorphous, cheese-like necrotic debris resulting from macrophage death. This finding is strongly suggestive of an infectious etiology, most classically Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
  * Non-Caseating Granulomas: Composed of tightly packed epithelioid cells without a central necrotic core. This pattern is the hallmark of non-infectious inflammatory conditions like Sarcoidosis but is also seen in foreign body reactions and certain fungal infections like GIFRS.

Part I: Infectious Granulomatous Diseases

Infectious agents are a common cause of granulomatous inflammation, particularly organisms capable of intracellular survival that provoke the host to contain the persistent pathogen.

A. Mycobacterial Infections

1. Tuberculosis (TB)
  * Etiology: Caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sinonasal involvement is almost always secondary to pulmonary TB.
  * Sinonasal Manifestations: Patients present with chronic nasal obstruction, purulent or bloody rhinorrhea, and extensive crusting. The inflammation leads to nodular thickenings or ulcerations, which can cause perforation of the cartilaginous nasal septum. A key feature is that the underlying bony framework is usually spared, meaning a "saddle nose deformity" is not a classic sign.
  * Cutaneous Manifestations (Lupus Vulgaris): This is the most common form of cutaneous TB, presenting as reddish-brown papules that coalesce into plaques, particularly on the head and neck. Diascopy reveals pathognomonic "apple-jelly" nodules. It is a chronic, destructive process that can lead to significant scarring and carries a long-term risk of developing skin cancer.
  * Diagnosis: Histopathology reveals caseating epithelioid granulomas with Langhans giant cells. Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) can confirm the diagnosis, though organisms may be sparse. Culture is the gold standard but is slow; PCR is a more rapid alternative.
2. Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)
  * Etiology: Caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The clinical presentation exists on a spectrum from tuberculoid (strong immune response, few lesions) to lepromatous (weak immune response, widespread disease).
  * Sinonasal Manifestations: Nasal involvement is a cardinal feature, occurring in up to 95% of patients, especially in the lepromatous form. Early symptoms include chronic nasal stuffiness and crusting. The chronic granulomatous infiltration leads to mucosal atrophy, perforation of the cartilaginous septum, and, ultimately, the collapse of underlying support structures, resulting in the classic "saddle nose" deformity.
  * Cutaneous Manifestations: The hallmark is skin lesions with a definite loss of sensation. Lesions range from few and well-demarcated (tuberculoid) to numerous and symmetrically distributed (lepromatous). Diffuse infiltration of facial skin creates the characteristic "leonine facies," often with loss of eyebrows and eyelashes.
  * Diagnosis: Primarily clinical, based on anesthetic skin lesions or thickened peripheral nerves. Biopsy is confirmatory; tuberculoid leprosy shows well-formed granulomas, while lepromatous leprosy shows foamy macrophages (Virchow cells) filled with vast numbers of AFB.

B. Other Bacterial Infections

1. Rhinoscleroma
  * Etiology: A chronic granulomatous infection caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It is endemic in regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central/South America.
  * Clinical Stages:
    * Catarrhal Stage: Mimics chronic rhinitis with foul-smelling purulent discharge and crusting.
    * Granulomatous Stage: Painless, rubbery, reddish granulomatous nodules form in the nasal submucosa, causing severe nasal obstruction without ulceration.
    * Sclerotic Stage: Granulomatous tissue is replaced by dense scar tissue, leading to stenosis and permanent deformities.
  * Diagnosis: Histopathology is definitive, revealing pathognomonic Mikulicz cells (large, vacuolated macrophages containing the bacilli) and Russell bodies (degenerated plasma cells).
2. Syphilis
  * Etiology: Caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Sinonasal involvement is a feature of congenital and tertiary disease.
  * Sinonasal Manifestations: Congenital syphilis can cause persistent rhinitis ("snuffles"). In tertiary syphilis, the characteristic lesion is the gumma, a localized granuloma that undergoes central necrosis and forms a deep, destructive ulcer. This process can destroy both cartilage and bone, leading to septal and palatal perforation and a severe saddle nose deformity.
  * Diagnosis: Based on serological tests (VDRL, RPR, FTA-ABS) and biopsy showing granulomatous inflammation with plasma cell infiltrate and endarteritis obliterans.

C. Fungal Infections

1. Granulomatous Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis (GIFRS)
  * Etiology & Epidemiology: An uncommon form of invasive fungal sinusitis, most often caused by Aspergillus flavus. It occurs almost exclusively in immunocompetent hosts in arid, tropical regions.
  * Clinical Presentation: Characterized by an indolent, slowly progressive course over months to years. Patients present with an expanding, unilateral mass causing nasal obstruction, facial swelling, and proptosis (bulging eye). It is often mistaken for a malignancy.
  * Pathophysiology: The disease is driven by a hyper-responsive, but ineffective, T-cell-mediated granulomatous reaction against the fungus. The exuberant inflammation itself forms the space-occupying lesion, which "invades" by mass effect rather than angioinvasion.
  * Diagnosis: Histopathology shows extensive, non-caseating granulomas with sparse fungal hyphae, often within giant cells, and an absence of significant vascular invasion.
  * Treatment: Requires a combination of radical surgical debridement and prolonged systemic antifungal therapy (e.g., itraconazole, voriconazole).
2. Mucormycosis ("Black Fungus")
  * Etiology & Epidemiology: A severe, often fulminant, fungal infection caused by molds of the order Mucorales (e.g., Rhizopus). It typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals, with major risk factors including poorly controlled diabetes (especially DKA), low white blood cell counts, organ transplant, and long-term steroid use.
  * Clinical Presentation: Tends to progress rapidly. It most commonly infects the sinuses, brain, and eyes, causing one-sided facial swelling, headache, fever, and rapidly progressing black necrotic lesions on the nose or palate due to tissue death.
  * Pathophysiology: The fungus is angioinvasive, growing into blood vessels, causing thrombosis, and leading to extensive tissue necrosis.
  * Diagnosis & Treatment: Diagnosis requires biopsy to identify the characteristic wide, ribbon-like, non-septate hyphae branching at right angles. Treatment is urgent and involves aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue combined with systemic antifungal therapy, typically Amphotericin B.

Part II: Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases

This category includes systemic disorders where a dysregulated immune response drives granuloma formation.

A. ANCA-Associated Vasculitides

1. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)
  * Pathophysiology: A rare systemic autoimmune disease defined by a triad of: 1) necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract, 2) necrotizing vasculitis of small-to-medium vessels, and 3) glomerulonephritis. It is strongly associated with cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) targeting proteinase 3 (PR3).
  * Sinonasal Manifestations: The upper respiratory tract is affected in up to 90% of patients and is often the initial site of disease. Symptoms include bloody nasal discharge, extensive crusting, ulceration, and septal perforation, which can lead to a saddle nose deformity.
  * Cutaneous Manifestations: Affects about 50% of patients, with the most characteristic lesion being palpable purpura on the lower extremities. Subcutaneous nodules and ulcers can also occur.
  * Systemic Involvement: A multisystem disease commonly affecting the lungs (nodules, hemorrhage) and kidneys (rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis), which can lead to organ failure if untreated.
  * Treatment: Involves potent immunosuppression, typically with high-dose corticosteroids combined with rituximab or cyclophosphamide to induce remission, followed by maintenance therapy.
2. Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)
  * Pathophysiology: A rare immune disorder characterized by hypereosinophilia (high levels of eosinophils), inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), and granuloma formation. It often affects multiple organs, especially the lungs.
  * Clinical Presentation: Often develops in phases, with many patients having a history of late-onset or worsening asthma, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis that precedes the systemic vasculitic phase. Nonspecific symptoms include fever, fatigue, and joint/muscle pain.
  * Systemic Involvement: Commonly affects the lungs, peripheral nerves (numbness, tingling, pain), skin (rashes, nodules), gastrointestinal tract, and heart. Cardiac involvement is a major cause of death in untreated patients. About 30-50% of patients are ANCA-positive.
  * Treatment: Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment. More severe cases may require other immunosuppressants or biologic agents that target eosinophils, such as mepolizumab or benralizumab.

B. Systemic Granulomatous Disorders of Unknown Etiology

1. Sarcoidosis
  * Pathophysiology: A multisystem inflammatory disorder defined by the presence of well-formed, non-caseating epithelioid granulomas in affected organs. The cause is unknown but is thought to be an exaggerated immune response to an unidentified antigen.
  * Sinonasal Manifestations: Occurs in a minority of patients. The process is primarily infiltrative, not destructive. The nasal mucosa appears swollen and boggy, with a nodular or "cobblestoned" appearance. Destructive lesions like septal perforation and saddle nose are distinctly uncommon.
  * Cutaneous Manifestations: Common (25% of patients). Specific lesions containing granulomas include papules, plaques, and the pathognomonic lupus pernio—violaceous, indurated plaques on the central face. Non-specific lesions like erythema nodosum (tender red nodules on the shins) also occur.
  * Systemic Involvement: The lungs and intrathoracic lymph nodes are affected in >90% of cases. Eyes, joints, liver, heart, and the nervous system can also be involved.
  * Diagnosis: Requires a compatible clinical picture, histopathological evidence of non-caseating granulomas, and the exclusion of other granulomatous diseases.

C. Other Autoimmune Considerations

* IgG4-Related Disease: An emerging fibro-inflammatory condition that can involve midline structures, presenting as mass-forming lesions or nasal/palatal erosions, adding to the differential diagnosis.

Part III: Neoplastic and Other Mimics

Certain malignancies and other conditions can produce clinical features that closely mimic primary granulomatous diseases.

1. Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type
  * Pathology: A rare, highly aggressive malignancy of NK-cell or T-cell lineage, strongly associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It was historically known as "lethal midline granuloma." The tumor is angiocentric and angiodestructive, causing extensive ischemic necrosis.
  * Clinical Presentation: Typically presents as a relentlessly progressive, destructive lesion in the midfacial region. Symptoms begin like chronic sinusitis but evolve into a necrotic tumor mass that destroys the nasal septum, palate, and sinuses, causing severe disfigurement.
  * Diagnosis: Requires a deep tissue biopsy. Histology shows an angiocentric infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells with prominent necrosis. Diagnosis is confirmed with immunohistochemistry (CD56+) and EBER in-situ hybridization for EBV.
2. Cocaine-Induced Midline Destructive Lesions (CIMDL)
  * Pathology: Habitual nasal insufflation of cocaine causes intense vasoconstriction, leading to ischemic necrosis and extensive destruction of the osteocartilaginous structures of the nose, sinuses, and palate.
  * Clinical Presentation: Patients present with septal perforation, turbinate destruction, and, characteristically, palate perforation (oro-nasal communication). Symptoms include nasal regurgitation of food, dysphagia, and halitosis.
  * Diagnostic Challenge: CIMDL can closely mimic GPA, both clinically and histologically. Furthermore, a significant portion of CIMDL patients may test positive for ANCA, confounding the diagnosis.
  * Key Differentiator: The presence of palate perforation is a powerful clinical marker that strongly favors a diagnosis of CIMDL over GPA, as it is described in over 70 CIMDL cases in the literature but is exceptionally rare (and often poorly documented) in GPA.
3. Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)
  * Pathology: A primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by genetic mutations in the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex. This defect prevents phagocytes from generating reactive oxygen species to kill certain bacteria and fungi.
  * Clinical Presentation: Characterized by recurrent, life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections alongside chronic, dysregulated inflammation that leads to granuloma formation. Sinonasal symptoms include persistent rhinitis and frequent sinus infections. Skin is frequently affected with both infectious lesions (abscesses, cellulitis) and sterile inflammatory papules and pustules.
  * Diagnosis: Confirmed by functional assays of neutrophil oxidative burst (DHR test).

Diagnostic Approach and Management

A systematic, multidisciplinary approach is essential for accurate diagnosis.

Diagnostic Workup

Step	Method	Purpose
History & Exam	Detailed history (geography, immune status, substance use) and physical examination.	Distinguish infiltrative vs. destructive processes. Assess for systemic involvement.
Endoscopy	Visualization of nasal cavities.	Guide biopsy and assess mucosal appearance (e.g., ulceration, nodules, crusting, necrosis).
Imaging	CT scan of sinuses, Chest X-ray/CT.	CT is vital for assessing bone destruction. Chest imaging is crucial for identifying pulmonary involvement in TB, Sarcoidosis, and GPA.
Histopathology	Deep tissue biopsy is the cornerstone of diagnosis.	Identify key features: caseating vs. non-caseating granulomas, vasculitis, specific cell types (Mikulicz cells), or malignant infiltrates.
Serology	Blood tests.	ANCA (c-ANCA/anti-PR3 for GPA), ACE levels (Sarcoidosis), and treponemal tests (Syphilis).
Microbiology	Special stains (Ziehl-Neelsen, GMS) and cultures.	Identify infectious organisms (mycobacteria, fungi).

Key Diagnostic Challenges

* GPA vs. NK/T-cell Lymphoma: This is the most critical differential. Both cause severe midline destruction. An urgent, deep tissue biopsy with immunohistochemistry and EBER staining is mandatory to differentiate them, as their treatments (immunosuppression vs. chemotherapy) are diametrically opposed.
* GPA vs. CIMDL: The clinical overlap is significant, and ANCA tests can be misleading. The presence of palate perforation is the most reliable clinical sign pointing towards CIMDL.
* Sarcoidosis vs. GPA: Differentiated by the pattern of involvement: Sarcoidosis is typically infiltrative (swollen, nodular mucosa), while GPA is destructive (ulceration, bleeding, perforation).

Management Principles

Management is highly individualized based on the definitive diagnosis.

* Medical Management:
  * Infections: Prolonged courses of specific antimicrobials (antibiotics, antifungals).
  * Autoimmune Conditions: Systemic immunosuppression (corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, biologic agents).
* Surgical Management:
  * Diagnosis: Biopsy is a key surgical role.
  * Treatment: Debridement and resection of necrotic or fungal tissue (critical in Mucormycosis and GIFRS).
  * Reconstruction: May be necessary for complications like saddle nose deformity or palate perforation, ideally performed after the disease is in remission.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Answer Key

1. A granuloma is a distinct, highly organized pattern of chronic tissue reaction characterized by the focal aggregation of immune cells, with the macrophage being the central player. Its purpose is to contain and isolate persistent, non-degradable antigens or pathogens, effectively "walling off" the inciting agent to prevent its dissemination throughout the body.
2. GIFRS typically presents in immunocompetent hosts from arid, tropical regions as an indolent, slowly progressive, unilateral mass involving the sinuses, cheek, orbit, and nose. Key symptoms include progressive nasal obstruction and proptosis (bulging of the eye). The disease is frequently mistaken for a malignancy due to its mass-like appearance.
3. Sinonasal tuberculosis presents with chronic nasal obstruction, purulent or bloody rhinorrhea, and crusting, which can lead to perforation of the cartilaginous nasal septum but typically spares the bony bridge. The most common cutaneous form is lupus vulgaris, which appears as reddish-brown papules that form destructive plaques, and on diascopy, reveals classic "apple-jelly" nodules.
4. Rhinoscleroma progresses through three stages: the initial catarrhal stage with non-specific rhinitis symptoms; the granulomatous stage, where painless, rubbery nodules form, causing severe nasal obstruction; and the final sclerotic stage, where fibrosis leads to stenosis and permanent deformities.
5. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) is defined by a classic pathological triad consisting of: (1) necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, typically in the upper and lower respiratory tracts; (2) necrotizing vasculitis of small- to medium-sized blood vessels; and (3) pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis.
6. The sinonasal manifestations of Sarcoidosis are typically infiltrative, with the nasal mucosa appearing swollen, boggy, or "cobblestoned," causing obstruction. In contrast, GPA is a destructive process, commonly causing ulceration, bleeding, septal perforation, and saddle nose deformity, which are distinctly uncommon in Sarcoidosis.
7. The hallmark of EGPA is an abnormally high number of eosinophils in the blood and tissues (hypereosinophilia), vasculitis, and multi-organ involvement. Most patients develop asthma, often late-onset and resistant to standard treatments, which frequently precedes the development of more severe systemic symptoms.
8. Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma is a critical differential because it presents as a relentlessly progressive, destructive midline lesion that can mimic GPA. A misdiagnosis is catastrophic because the treatments are opposite: GPA requires profound immunosuppression, which would accelerate tumor growth in a lymphoma patient.
9. CGD is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in genes for the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex, rendering phagocytes unable to produce a "respiratory burst" to kill catalase-positive bacteria and fungi. This defect leads to recurrent severe infections and chronic inflammation, resulting in granuloma formation as the immune system attempts to contain pathogens it cannot eliminate.
10. Palate perforation is strongly suggestive of Cocaine-Induced Midline Destructive Lesions (CIMDL). A review of literature identified 73 CIMDL patients with this finding, compared to only 5 reported cases in patients with GPA. Therefore, in a patient with midline destructive lesions, negative biopsy, and negative ANCA tests, palatal perforation is a clinical marker that strongly favors a diagnosis of CIMDL over GPA.

## Note 16: Saddle Nose Deformity - Differential Diagnosis

```markdown
# Saddle Nose Deformity - Differential Diagnosis

## Definition
Collapse of nasal bridge due to destruction of underlying cartilaginous/bony support

## Differential Diagnosis by Tissue Destroyed

### Cartilage AND Bone Destruction
**Syphilis (tertiary)**: Gumma formation
**Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**: Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation

### Predominantly Cartilage Destruction
**Leprosy**: Chronic granulomatous infiltration
**Relapsing Polychondritis**: Autoimmune cartilage destruction

### Variable Pattern
**Cocaine-Induced**: Ischemic necrosis
**Trauma**: Direct structural injury

## What Does NOT Typically Cause Saddle Nose
**Tuberculosis (sinonasal)**: Bony bridge usually spared
**Sarcoidosis**: Infiltrative, not destructive

## Diagnostic Workup
When encountering saddle nose deformity:
1. Detailed history (substance use, systemic symptoms, geography)
2. ANCA testing (GPA)
3. Treponemal tests (syphilis)
4. Biopsy of any active lesions
5. Assess for systemic involvement

# Midline Destructive Lesions - Diagnostic Approach

## Critical Differential Diagnosis
The "Big Three" life-threatening causes:
1. [[Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)]]
2. [[Extranodal NK-T Cell Lymphoma]]
3. [[Cocaine-Induced Midline Destructive Lesions (CIMDL)]]

## Why This Matters
**Treatments are diametrically opposed**:
- GPA: Profound immunosuppression
- Lymphoma: Chemotherapy/radiation
- CIMDL: Cessation, supportive care

**Misdiagnosis consequences**: CATASTROPHIC
- Immunosuppressing lymphoma → accelerates tumor
- Chemotherapy for GPA → unnecessary toxicity

## Systematic Diagnostic Workup

### Step 1: History
- **Geography**: TB, leprosy, endemic fungi
- **Immune status**: Opportunistic infections
- **Substance use**: Cocaine (essential to ask directly)
- **Systemic symptoms**: Constitutional, renal, pulmonary

### Step 2: Examination
- **Palate**: Perforation strongly favors CIMDL
- **Nasal cavity**: Ulceration (GPA) vs mass (lymphoma, GIFRS)
- **Skin**: Palpable purpura (GPA), anesthetic lesions (leprosy)

### Step 3: Endoscopy
- Guide biopsy site
- Assess mucosal appearance, extent of destruction

### Step 4: Imaging
- **CT sinuses**: Bone destruction pattern
- **Chest imaging**: TB, sarcoidosis, GPA, EGPA

### Step 5: Histopathology - CORNERSTONE
**Mandatory**: Deep tissue biopsy

**Key Features**:
- Caseating vs non-caseating granulomas
- Vasculitis
- Atypical lymphoid cells
- Specific cells (Mikulicz, lepra cells)

**Special Stains**: Ziehl-Neelsen (AFB), GMS (fungi)
**Immunohistochemistry**: CD56 (NK/T lymphoma)
**In-situ hybridization**: EBER (EBV in lymphoma)

### Step 6: Serology
- **ANCA** (c-ANCA/anti-PR3 for GPA) - but can be positive in CIMDL
- **ACE levels** (sarcoidosis)
- **Treponemal tests** (syphilis)

### Step 7: Microbiology
- Cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi
- PCR for rapid pathogen identification

## Key Clinical Clues

| Finding | Favors Diagnosis |
|---------|------------------|
| Palate perforation | CIMDL >> GPA |
| Rapidly progressive necrosis | NK/T lymphoma, Mucormycosis |
| Infiltrative, not destructive | Sarcoidosis, GIFRS |
| Late-onset asthma | EGPA |
| Renal involvement | GPA, EGPA |
| Immunocompromised host | Opportunistic infections (Mucor, TB) |

**Note 1: Granulomatous Inflammation**
```markdown
# Granulomatous Inflammation

Granulomatous inflammation is a distinct pattern of chronic tissue reaction characterized by the focal aggregation of immune cells, primarily macrophages. It is a host defense mechanism designed to contain and isolate persistent, non-degradable agents that conventional inflammatory processes have failed to eliminate.

The formation of a granuloma is a cytokine-driven process involving IFN-γ and TNF-α, which transform macrophages into epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells. While protective, the granuloma itself can cause tissue damage through mass effect and the release of inflammatory mediators.

*   **Caseating Granulomas**: Have a central core of "cheese-like" necrotic debris. Strongly associated with infectious causes, classically [[Tuberculosis (TB) - Sinonasal and Cutaneous Manifestations]].
*   **Non-Caseating Granulomas**: Lack central necrosis. Hallmark of non-infectious inflammatory conditions like [[Sarcoidosis - Sinonasal and Cutaneous Manifestations]], but also seen in [[Granulomatous Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis (GIFRS)]].

**Note 2: Tuberculosis (TB) - Sinonasal and Cutaneous Manifestations**
```markdown
# Tuberculosis (TB) - Sinonasal and Cutaneous Manifestations

Sinonasal tuberculosis, caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, is almost always secondary to pulmonary TB. It presents with chronic nasal obstruction, purulent or bloody rhinorrhea, and extensive crusting, which can lead to cartilaginous septal perforation. A key feature is the sparing of the underlying bony framework, making a "saddle nose deformity" uncommon.

*   **Cutaneous TB (Lupus Vulgaris)**: The most common form, presenting as reddish-brown papules coalescing into destructive plaques. Diascopy reveals pathognomonic "apple-jelly" nodules.
*   **Diagnosis**: Based on histopathology showing caseating epithelioid granulomas with Langhans giant cells. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) may be seen on Ziehl-Neelsen stain, but culture is the gold standard.

# Leprosy (Hansen's Disease) - Sinonasal and Cutaneous Manifestations

Leprosy, caused by *Mycobacterium leprae*, has significant sinonasal manifestations, occurring in up to 95% of patients, especially in the lepromatous form. Chronic granulomatous infiltration leads to mucosal atrophy, cartilaginous septal perforation, and ultimately the classic "saddle nose" deformity due to the collapse of support structures.

*   **Cutaneous Hallmark**: Skin lesions with a definite loss of sensation.
*   **Leonine Facies**: Diffuse infiltration of facial skin, characteristic of the lepromatous form.
*   **Diagnosis**: Primarily clinical (anesthetic skin lesions, thickened nerves). Biopsy of lepromatous leprosy shows foamy macrophages (Virchow cells) filled with AFB.

**Note 4: Rhinoscleroma**
```markdown
# Rhinoscleroma

Rhinoscleroma is a chronic, progressive granulomatous infection of the upper respiratory tract caused by *Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis*. It is endemic in specific regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central/South America.

The disease progresses through three clinical stages:
1.  **Catarrhal Stage**: Mimics chronic rhinitis with foul-smelling purulent discharge.
2.  **Granulomatous Stage**: Characterized by the formation of painless, rubbery, reddish submucosal nodules causing severe nasal obstruction without ulceration.
3.  **Sclerotic Stage**: Fibrosis replaces granulomatous tissue, leading to stenosis and permanent deformity.

*   **Diagnosis**: Histopathology is definitive, revealing pathognomonic **Mikulicz cells** (vacuolated macrophages containing bacilli) and **Russell bodies** (degenerated plasma cells).

**Note 5: Syphilis - Sinonasal Manifestations**
```markdown
# Syphilis - Sinonasal Manifestations

Sinonasal involvement in syphilis, caused by *Treponema pallidum*, is a feature of congenital and tertiary disease. In tertiary syphilis, the characteristic lesion is the **gumma**, a localized granuloma that undergoes central necrosis to form a deep, destructive ulcer.

This process is highly destructive, capable of destroying both cartilage and bone. This can lead to severe complications, including:
*   Septal perforation
*   Palatal perforation
*   Severe saddle nose deformity

*   **Diagnosis**: Based on serological tests (VDRL, RPR, FTA-ABS) and biopsy showing granulomatous inflammation with plasma cell infiltrate and endarteritis obliterans.

**Note 6: Granulomatous Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis (GIFRS)**
```markdown
# Granulomatous Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis (GIFRS)

GIFRS is an uncommon form of invasive fungal sinusitis, typically caused by *Aspergillus flavus*. It occurs almost exclusively in immunocompetent hosts in arid, tropical regions.

The clinical course is indolent and slowly progressive, presenting as an expanding, unilateral mass causing nasal obstruction, facial swelling, and proptosis. It is often mistaken for a malignancy. The disease is driven by a hyper-responsive but ineffective T-cell mediated granulomatous reaction against the fungus, with invasion occurring by mass effect rather than angioinvasion.

*   **Diagnosis**: Histopathology shows extensive, non-caseating granulomas with sparse fungal hyphae.
*   **Treatment**: Requires radical surgical debridement combined with prolonged systemic antifungal therapy.

**Note 7: Mucormycosis**
```markdown
# Mucormycosis

Mucormycosis ("Black Fungus") is a severe, often fulminant fungal infection caused by molds of the order Mucorales. It typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals, with major risk factors including poorly controlled diabetes (especially DKA), neutropenia, and long-term steroid use.

The fungus is angioinvasive, growing into blood vessels, which causes thrombosis and leads to extensive tissue necrosis. This results in rapidly progressing black necrotic lesions on the nose or palate.

*   **Clinical Presentation**: Rapid progression with one-sided facial swelling, headache, fever, and black necrotic eschar.
*   **Diagnosis**: Biopsy is required to identify the characteristic wide, ribbon-like, non-septate hyphae.
*   **Treatment**: An emergency requiring aggressive surgical debridement and systemic antifungal therapy (Amphotericin B).

**Note 8: Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)**
```markdown
# Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)

GPA (formerly Wegener's) is a systemic autoimmune disease defined by a triad of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract, necrotizing vasculitis, and glomerulonephritis. It is strongly associated with cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) targeting proteinase 3 (PR3).

Sinonasal involvement is the initial presentation in up to 90% of patients, causing bloody discharge, extensive crusting, ulceration, and septal perforation, which can lead to a saddle nose deformity.

*   **Systemic Features**: Affects lungs (nodules, hemorrhage) and kidneys (glomerulonephritis).
*   **Cutaneous Features**: Palpable purpura is the most characteristic lesion.
*   **Treatment**: Potent immunosuppression (corticosteroids with rituximab or cyclophosphamide).

# Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)

EGPA (formerly Churg-Strauss) is a rare immune disorder characterized by hypereosinophilia, vasculitis, and granuloma formation. It often develops in phases, with many patients having a history of late-onset or worsening asthma and allergic rhinitis that precedes the systemic vasculitic phase.

The disease commonly affects the lungs, peripheral nerves, skin, GI tract, and heart. Cardiac involvement is a major cause of mortality.

*   **Key Feature**: History of late-onset or worsening asthma is very common.
*   **ANCA Status**: About 30-50% of patients are ANCA-positive.
*   **Treatment**: Corticosteroids are first-line. Biologics targeting eosinophils (e.g., mepolizumab) are used for severe cases.

# Sarcoidosis - Sinonasal and Cutaneous Manifestations

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown cause, defined by well-formed, non-caseating epithelioid granulomas.

Sinonasal involvement is infiltrative, not destructive. The mucosa appears swollen and boggy with a nodular or "cobblestoned" appearance. Destructive lesions like septal perforation are distinctly uncommon, which helps differentiate it from [[Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)]].

*   **Cutaneous Lesions**: Common (25%), including the pathognomonic **lupus pernio** (violaceous plaques on the central face).
*   **Systemic Involvement**: Lungs and intrathoracic lymph nodes are affected in >90% of cases.
*   **Diagnosis**: Requires compatible clinical picture, biopsy showing non-caseating granulomas, and exclusion of other causes.

# IgG4-Related Disease

IgG4-Related Disease is an emerging fibro-inflammatory condition characterized by mass-forming lesions infiltrated with IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis.

It can involve midline structures, presenting as mass-forming lesions or nasal/palatal erosions. This presentation places it in the differential diagnosis for other granulomatous and destructive midline diseases.

*   **Clinical Pearl**: It should be considered in the differential for destructive midline lesions, alongside conditions like [[Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)]] and [[Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type]].

**Note 12: Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type**
```markdown
# Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type

This is a rare, highly aggressive malignancy of NK-cell or T-cell lineage, strongly associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It was historically known as "lethal midline granuloma."

The tumor is angiocentric and angiodestructive, causing extensive ischemic necrosis. It presents as a relentlessly progressive, destructive lesion in the midfacial region, evolving from sinusitis-like symptoms to a necrotic tumor mass that destroys the nose, palate, and sinuses.

*   **Critical Differential**: Must be distinguished from [[Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)]]. Misdiagnosis is catastrophic, as immunosuppression for GPA would accelerate the lymphoma.
*   **Diagnosis**: Requires deep tissue biopsy. Confirmed with immunohistochemistry (CD56+) and EBER in-situ hybridization for EBV.

**Note 13: Cocaine-Induced Midline Destructive Lesions (CIMDL)**
```markdown
# Cocaine-Induced Midline Destructive Lesions (CIMDL)

CIMDL results from habitual nasal insufflation of cocaine, which causes intense vasoconstriction, leading to ischemic necrosis and extensive destruction of the osteocartilaginous structures of the nose, sinuses, and palate.

CIMDL can closely mimic [[Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)]] clinically and histologically. A significant portion of CIMDL patients may even test positive for ANCA, creating a diagnostic challenge.

*   **Key Differentiator**: The presence of **palate perforation** is a powerful clinical marker that strongly favors a diagnosis of CIMDL over GPA.
*   **Symptoms**: Nasal regurgitation of food, dysphagia, and halitosis are common due to oro-nasal communication.

**Note 14: Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)**
```markdown
# Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)

CGD is a primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by genetic mutations in the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex. This defect prevents phagocytes from generating reactive oxygen species (respiratory burst) to kill certain bacteria and fungi.

The disease is characterized by two main features:
1.  Recurrent, life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections.
2.  Chronic, dysregulated inflammation leading to granuloma formation as the immune system attempts to contain pathogens it cannot eliminate.

*   **Sinonasal Symptoms**: Persistent rhinitis and frequent sinus infections.
*   **Diagnosis**: Confirmed by functional assays of neutrophil oxidative burst (e.g., DHR test).

**Note 15: Diagnostic Approach to Chronic Granulomatous Sinonasal Diseases**
```markdown
# Diagnostic Approach to Chronic Granulomatous Sinonasal Diseases

A systematic, multidisciplinary approach is essential for diagnosing chronic granulomatous sinonasal diseases due to significant overlap in clinical presentation. The cornerstone of diagnosis is a deep tissue biopsy for histopathological analysis.

**Key Diagnostic Steps:**
1.  **History & Exam**: Note geography, immune status, substance use. Distinguish infiltrative vs. destructive processes.
2.  **Endoscopy**: Guide biopsy and assess mucosal appearance (ulceration, nodules, necrosis).
3.  **Imaging (CT)**: Vital for assessing bone destruction.
4.  **Histopathology**: The cornerstone. Look for caseating vs. non-caseating granulomas, vasculitis, specific cell types, or malignant infiltrates.
5.  **Serology**: ANCA for [[Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)]], ACE for [[Sarcoidosis - Sinonasal and Cutaneous Manifestations]], treponemal tests for [[Syphilis - Sinonasal Manifestations]].
6.  **Microbiology**: Special stains and cultures to identify infectious organisms.

**Critical Differentials:**
*   **GPA vs. NK/T-cell Lymphoma**: Urgent biopsy is mandatory.
*   **GPA vs. CIMDL**: Palate perforation is a key clinical sign for [[Cocaine-Induced Midline Destructive Lesions (CIMDL)]].
*   **Sarcoidosis vs. GPA**: Sarcoidosis is infiltrative; GPA is destructive.
