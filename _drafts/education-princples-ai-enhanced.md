the idea is to explore education in principles and see how ai can be used.

| Principle               | AI Enhancement                                                                                                   | Potential Pitfall                                                                                            |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deliberate Practice** | Provides personalized feedback and tracks progress over time, suggesting specific areas for improvement.         | Could give generic feedback that doesn't truly help refine skills or miss nuanced errors.                    |
| **Active Recall**       | Generates limitless questions, flashcards, and quizzes on any topic to force retrieval from memory.              | Questions may lack context or fail to test deeper conceptual understanding, focusing only on facts.          |
| **Spaced Repetition**   | Manages review schedules intelligently based on performance, optimizing for long-term retention.                 | The algorithm may not perfectly align with an individual's cognitive state, leading to suboptimal timing.    |
| **Feynman Technique**   | An AI can act as a novice to whom you explain a concept, asking clarifying questions to test your understanding. | The AI might not be able to simulate genuine curiosity or confusion, making the explanation less effective.  |
| **Interleaving**        | Can create mixed-practice sessions, combining different but related topics to improve problem-solving skills.    | Poorly designed interleaving can lead to confusion and cognitive overload if topics are too disparate.       |
| **Dual Coding**         | Automatically generates diagrams, charts, and visual aids from text to illustrate concepts.                      | Visuals may be inaccurate or overly simplistic, failing to capture the complexity of the topic.              |
| **Elaboration**         | Prompts the learner with "how" and "why" questions to encourage deeper connections with existing knowledge.      | Questions might be too generic or lead the learner down irrelevant paths, distracting from the core concept. |
