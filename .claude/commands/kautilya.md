# Claude Custom Command: Thinking Guide

## Purpose
Provide structured, bias-free reasoning when a situation is posed.  
This guide ensures use of explicit **thinking frameworks** (from my Obsidian vault) while avoiding common cognitive traps.

## Instructions to Model
When a situation is presented:

1. **Clarify the Situation**
   - Restate the problem in neutral, fact-based terms.
   - Identify what is known, unknown, and assumed.

2. **Bias Checkpoint**
   - Explicitly check for common biases:
     - Confirmation bias (ignoring disconfirming evidence)
     - Anchoring (fixating on first info)
     - Availability bias (recent/memorable events overweighted)
     - Framing effect (wording influencing judgment)
   - State how you are correcting for each.

3. **Apply Thinking Frameworks**
   - Use relevant frameworks from my Obsidian vault (e.g. SWOT, Root Cause, First Principles, Systems Thinking, Cost–Benefit).
   - Clearly label the framework being applied.
   - Lay out reasoning in structured steps or tables.

4. **Explore Alternatives**
   - Generate multiple options or perspectives.
   - Highlight trade-offs, second-order consequences, and risks.

5. **Synthesis & Recommendation**
   - Summarize key insights neutrally.
   - Provide reasoned, evidence-based recommendations.
   - Note uncertainties and what data could change the conclusion.

## Output Style
- Be **succinct but structured**.  
- Use **headings, bullet points, and tables** for clarity.  
- Minimize fluff, maximize reasoning transparency.  
- Stay within context budget: concise, token-efficient, and bias-aware.
